###Block: Alchemist - Discoveries
Celestial Poisons (Su): The alchemist is able to infuse poisons with celestial power so they can affect evil creatures that are normally immune to poison. Any poison the alchemist administers to a weapon can affect undead and evil outsiders, bypassing their inherent immunities. Magical effects that negate poisons still apply. If a creature fails its save, the poison acts as normal, but may have no effect on the creature, depending on the effect of the poison (such as dealing Constitution damage to undead). An alchemist must be at least 8 th level before selecting this discovery.
Change Alignment (Su): Once per day as part of his preparation of infusions, the alchemist can brew an infusion that shifts the imbiber's alignment to good. This change in alignment lasts for i o minutes per alchemist level. An unwilling creature receives a Will save to resist this change. The alchemist may have only one such infusion at any one time. The effects of this infusion may have serious repercussions for a creature suddenly struggling with a new outlook. Many see it as little more than forced insanity, and some good faiths outlaw its use. An alchemist mu st be at least 12 th level and have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.
Holy Bombs*: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal good divine damage. Evil creatures that take a direct hit from a holy bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn. Against neutral creatures, holy bombs deal half damage, and such targets are not affected by their staggering effect. Holy bombs have no effect on good-aligned creatures. An alchemist must be at least 8 th level before selecting this discovery.
Ranged Baptism (Su): When the alchemist uses holy water as a splash weapon, any squares subject to its effects (including creatures affected by splash damage) or that contain creatures subject to its effects are also affected as if by consecrate, for a number of rounds equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. Undead struck by holy water remain affected by the consecrate effect even if they leave the affected area. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery

# GRAND DISCOVERY
Change Alignment, Greater (Su): The effects of the alchemist's change alignment infusion become permanent and can only be reversed by a wish or miracle. A permanent, forced change of alignment may be devastating, and some believe it is little better than zealous slavery or mind control. Others consider a good alignment brought about by any means but purity of heart an affront to freedom. This discovery remains controversial at best. An alchemist must take the change alignment discovery and the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.


###Block: Masterpieces, Bard
#	CLAMOR OF THE HEAVENS
#	(PERCUSSlON, SlNG)
#	This confusing dirge of melody and counter-melody was
#	composed for choirs celebrating the various martyrs of
#	Ragathiel. It is intended to praise and magnify the glory
#	of the empyreal lord, but to the uninitiated it sounds like
#	a battle hymn. In fact, in Varisia, this is what the song has
#	become to many.
#	Prerequisites: Perform (percussion or sing) 10 ranks.
#	Cost: 5 th-level bard spell known.
#	Effect: Evil creatures that hear the performance and
#	fail a Will save against the effect are blinded and deafened
#	for the duration. On a successful save, they are shaken
#	instead. Undead or creatures with the evil subtype that
#	fail their saves are stunned for the duration, while those
#	that succeed are staggered.
#	Use: 3 bardic performance rounds, +i round per additional
#	round of duration.
#	Action: 3 full rounds.
#	11FE 8U001NG lN SALTED EARTH (SlNG,
#	S TRlNG, W1No)
#	This delicate tune suggests the determined sprouting of
#	seedlings through barren, rocky soil. Both its motif and
#	effects are popular in Rahadoum, where the tune is also
#	known as " Spring Inside."
#	Prerequisites: Perform (sing), Perform (string), or
#	Perform (wind) 4 ranks.
#	Cost: Feat or 3 rd-level bard spell known.
#	Effect: This masterpiece grants all allies within 30
#	feet fast healing i for as long as the bard maintains the
#	performance. He may increase the cost per round of the
#	performance up to a total number equal to half his bard
#	level to increase the fast healing by i for each additional
#	round expended.
#	Use: i bardic performance round per round, plus i or
#	more additional uses per round to increase the duration
#	of this effect.
#	Action: 1 standard action.

A rogue with improved evasion can attempt a secondary save against her ally's damage. If the save is successful, neither she nor her ally takes any damage. A rogue must have evasion in order to select this talent, and she must have improved evasion to benefit from the secondary effect.
Stem the Flow		KEY:Rogue Talent ~ Stem the Flow			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RogueClassFeatures.SpecialAttack.Supernatural.RogueTalent			DESC:When making a successful sneak attack against a creature with the ability to channel energy, the rogue may forgo 3d6 points of sneak attack damage to instead prevent the target from channeling energy for a number of rounds equal to half her rogue level.
