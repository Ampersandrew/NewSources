# 3-point
#Alignment Smite (Su): Choose a single alignment component that opposes one of the summoner's own. Once per day as a swift action, the eidolon chooses one target within sight. If this target's alignment matches that chosen for this ability, the eidolon deals an additional +1d6 points of damage with one of its natural weapons. This attack is treated as good-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. The alignment smite persists until the target is dead or the eidolon is dismissed. At 10 th level, the summoner may spend 1 additional evolution point to allow the eidolon a second daily use of this ability. The summoner must be at least 5 th level before selecting this evolution. Evil or true neutral summoners cannot select this evolution.
# TODO add higher level version.
