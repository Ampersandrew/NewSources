# Werebats and Werebat Kin Traits	p.9
Fight with the Flock: You have always been most comfortable in a group. Since awakening to your werebat powers, this feeling has only grown. As long as you are within 10 feet of at least two allies, you gain a +i trait bonus on Intimidate checks and attack rolls to make attack of opportunity.
Precision Hearing: You have long relied on your enhanced hearing to warn you of those who would persecute you for your nature. Whenever you succeed at a Perception check to hear a creature you can't see and your check exceeds the DC by 10 or more, you can pinpoint the exact square where the sound originated.

#WEREBOAR-K1 N TRA1TS
Boar Resilience: You were victimized by bullies or even abusive adults. Although the harassment got worse when your wereboar features became more obvious, those features also gave you fortitude that helped you resist it. You are unimpaired by being at exactly o hit points. In addition, you can ignore the Endurance prerequisite for the Diehard feat.
Strength of Body: You took longer than most to learn control over your transforming abilities, but in that time you learned a trick to make the most of your strength. Once per day, you can use your Strength modifier in place of your Constitution modifier on a single Fortitude saving throw. You must announce that you are using this ability before you roll the saving throw.


# NEW BARBAR1AN RAGE POWERS
Armor R.ipper: While raging, you gain a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks made to sunder with any of your natural attacks.
Boar's Charge: While raging, when you hit with a gore attack as part of a charge, you automatically score a critical threat. You must still confirm the critical hit as normal. You must be at least i2th level to select this rage power.
Deathless Frenzy: While raging, you ignore the effects of being at o or fewer hit points until you have been at o or fewer hit points for i round, at which point the appropriate consequences for your current hit point total take effect. Even death can be postponed this way, potentially allowing you to survive if you receive sufficient healing before the round is up. You must be at least uth level to select this rage power.
Disemboweling Tusks: While raging, when you confirm a critical hit with your gore attack, you deal id4 points of Constitution damage in addition to the normal damage for the gore attack. You must be at least 10th level to select this rage power.
Fueled by Vengeance: While raging, whenever you deal weapon damage to a creature that dealt damage to you since the end of your last turn, add i round to your remaining number of rounds of rage for the current day. You can gain no more than i extra round of rage each round. You must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.
Savage Intuition: Your bestial senses allow you to sense danger and become enraged before you even have time to consciously react to danger. When combat begins, if you have rounds of rage remaining, you may automatically enter a rage without using an action at the start of the first round of combat (or at the start of the surprise round, if there is one), even if you are not otherwise aware that combat has begun.

Crocodile Swim: You grew up near crocodiles, learning to move as they do. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Swim and Stealth checks while moving at half speed or less and mostly or completely underwater. One of these skills (your choice) becomes a class skill for you.
Terrifying Lunge: Once badly bitten by a stronger werecrocodile-kin, you learned the importance of showing your strength. Once per day, when you hit a f lat-footed foe with a melee attack, you can make an Intimidate check to demoralize that foe as a swift action. Intimidate becomes a class skill for you.

# NEW WlTCH HEXES
Cursed Wound: The witch can curse a living creature, preventing it from healing completely. For a number of days equal to 3 + the witch's Intelligence modifier (minimum i), whenever the victim is the target of a conjuration (healing) spell or magical healing effect, the caster of the healing effect must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 11 + the witch's level) to end the hex. If the check fails, the healing effect functions as normal, except it cannot remove the last 10 points of damage the victim suffered. Similarly, natural healing, fast healing, and regeneration fail to cure the victim's last 10 points of damage. Thus, the victim's effective maximum number of hit points is io fewer than normal. A successful Will save reduces the duration of this hex to i round. At 5th level, the victim of this hex also takes a -2 penalty on Fortitude saving throws to avoid contracting a disease or poison from an injury. This is a curse effect and can be removed by remove curse.
Swamp's Grasp: The witch can cause an area to become an entangling quagmire. One io-foot square per witch level within 90 feet becomes difficult terrain for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the witch's Intelligence modifier. If the witch uses this hex again before the duration of the previous use has expired, the effects of the previous use of this hex end immediately.
# Major
Animal Skin: The witch can become any animal of a size from Tiny to Large whose skin she wears. This ability is similar to beast shape II, except she takes on the appearance of the specific individual from which the skin came.
Delicious Fright: The witch can feed on the fear of her victim. The target of this hex becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the witch's Intelligence modifier. As long as the witch remains within 30 feet of her target, she gains a + i morale bonus on attack rolls and a +i morale bonus on saving throws as long as this effect persists. A successful Will save reduces the duration of this hex to i round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

Inured to Disease: The first sign of your wererat heritage was your seeming imperviousness to disease. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Fortitude saving throws against diseases.
Rat Squeeze: You first discovered your wererat-related abilities while escaping someone, whether the authorities or a rival, and ever since you have honed your ability to squeeze out of tight situations. Whenever you use your skinwalker ability to change shape into your bestial form, you can squeeze through narrow spaces at least half as wide as your normal space without slowing your movement; each move into or through a narrow space counts as I square, though you still take all the normal penalties associated with squeezing.

# NEW ROGUE TALENTS
Disease Use: A rogue with this talent can apply filth from garbage, a sewer, a city street, a polluted area, or long-unwashed clothing or fur to a weapon as a standard action. Doing so causes the weapon to inf lict filth fever (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 557) on its next strike. The rogue does not risk exposure to this disease unless she is damaged by the weapon. After a successful attack with the weapon, the filth is dispersed and must be reapplied.
Face in the Crowd: A rogue with this talent can blend into groups easily. Opposed Perception and Sense Motive checks take a -2 penalty when made against the rogue's Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth checks if she's within 30 feet of at least two non-hostile characters of her apparent creature type. This penalty increases to -4 if she's within 30 feet of at least eight such creatures or is currently in a square occupied by a crowd.
Quick Scrounge: The rogue can search a creature, object, or area in half as much time as normal. If her Perception check would normally require a full-round action or less, it becomes one step shorter along the following progression: full-round action, standard action, move action, swift action, immediate action. This talent has no effect on Perception checks that are attempted as free actions or Perception checks that don't require an action.
Scavenger: A rogue with this talent can pick up and stow an object as a swift action instead of two separate move actions. She gains a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to pick the pockets of creatures that are stunned or disabled.
