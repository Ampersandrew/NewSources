Dark Tapestry
Associated Domain: Void
Replacement Power: The following granted power
replaces the guarded mind power of the Void domain.
It Came from Beyond (Su): Once per day when you cast
a summoning spell, any one creature you summon is
more powerful than normal. The creature gains the
advanced creature simple template. If you summon
more than one creature with a spell, only one of the
summoned creatures gains the advanced creature simple
template. A summoned creature that gains the advanced
creature simple template in this manner looks unusually
deformed or hideous. This ability works only on spells
you cast as a cleric-it does not work on spellcasting
abilities gained from any other spellcasting classes you
might have.
Replacement Domain Spells: 2nd-summon monster II,
5th-summon monster V, 7th-insanity.

Stars
Associated Domain: Void
Replacement Power: The following granted power
replaces the part the veil power of the Void domain.
The Stars Are Ri!Jht (Su): If you prepare your cleric spells
while the stars are visible to you, you can spontaneously
cast any of your domain spells from the Stars subdomain
by swapping out a spell of an equal spell level. Any Stars
subdomain spells that you cast while the stars are visible
to you heal you of an amount of damage equal to the
spell's level as you cast the spell.
Replacement Domain Spells: 2nd-hypnotic pattern,
7th-sunbeam, 9th-meteor swarm.
