###Block: Traits (Race)
Cellular Match	KEY:Trait ~ Cellular Match	PRERACE:1,Android			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.SpecialQuality.RaceTrait	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	DESC:Whenever you are affected by a polymorph spell or effect, your nanites adjust completely at a molecular level. For the duration of the polymorph effect, you are treated as only a humanoid for the purpose of effects that target creatures by type. For example, a ranger's favored enemy bonus against constructs wouldn't apply to you while you are polymorphed, but nor would spells such as make whole. This trait modifies part of the android's constructed racial trait, but otherwise that trait is unchanged (a polymorphed android still can't gain morale bonuses, is still immune to fear, and so on).
Nanite Revival	KEY:Trait ~ Nanite Revival	PRERACE:1,Android			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.SpecialQuality.RaceTrait	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	DESC:You can instinctively activate your nanites to save your life. Once per day as an immediate action, you can command your nanites to stabilize you while you are dying, even while unconscious or helpless. This does not count as a use of your nanite surge ability.
Adroit		KEY:Trait ~ Adroit		PRERACE:1,Kasathas		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.SpecialQuality.RaceTrait	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:If one of your hands is free and your base attack bonus is + 1 or higher, you can draw a weapon as a free action combined with any move action (including move actions to direct spells, manipulate items, stand up, and so on).
Spidery Climber	KEY:Trait ~ Spidery Climber	PRERACE:1,Kasathas		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Trait.SpecialQuality.RaceTrait	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:More hands means more handholds. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Climb checks. In addition, as long as you have two hands free, the DC to catch yourself on a wall while falling is equal to the wall's DC + 10, and the DC to catch yourself on a slope is equal to the slope's DC + 5.






###Block: Side Bar traits
# Sun-Blessed (magic): Your birth came at a time when the sun was auspiciously aligned with your birth sign. As a result, you have a natural affinity for light and life. Whenever you're affected by a healing effect that would heal more hit points than your maximum hit point total, you gain the excess healing as temporary hit points. You can gain up to a number of temporary hit points per day equal to your character level in this way. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute.	SOURCEPAGE:p.5
# Born under the Green Star (Castrovel): You were born on Castrovel and touched by the planet's profound psychic bounty. Treat your caster level as 1 higher when casting spells and spell-like abilities with the mind-affecting descriptor.	SOURCEPAGE:p.9


###Block: Class Archetype
BOW NOMAD	TYPE:RangerArchetype.RangerWildEmpathy.RangerEndurance.RangerFavoredTerrain.RangerCamouflage.RangerHideInPlainSight	CATEGORY:Archetype	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	PREHANDSGTEQ:4	PRECLASS:1,Ranger=1	DESC:Thanks to their four arms, kasathas can master a combat form native to their home world and rarely witnessed on Golarion-wielding two bows at once. This archetype is available to kasathas (and to other races with four or more arms at the GM's discretion).	ABILITY:Ranger Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|BOW NOMAD ~ Twin Bows|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=1	ABILITY:Ranger Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|BOW NOMAD ~ Combat Style|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=2			ABILITY:Ranger Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|BOW NOMAD ~ Agile Maneuvers|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=3		ABILITY:Ranger Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|BOW NOMAD ~ Trick Shot|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=1			ABILITY:Ranger Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|BOW NOMAD ~ Focused Fire|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=6		

Twin Bows		KEY:BOW NOMAD ~ Twin Bows		SORTKEY:Bow Nomad 1			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	DESC:At 1st level, a bow nomad can simultaneously wield a combination of two of any ofthe following ranged weapons: shortbow, longbow, and their composite versions. When a bow nomad makes a full attack with two bows, twoweapon penalties apply and can be offset with TwoWeapon Fighting feats. Since bows aren't light weapons, a bow nomad with Two-Weapon Fighting takes a -4 penalty on attacks with each ofher bows. Extra attacks from other sources, such as those granted by Manyshot or Rapid Shot, can be applied to only one of the wielded bows per round. This ability replaces wild empathy.		SOURCEPAGE:p.8
Combat Style	KEY:BOW NOMAD ~ Combat Style		SORTKEY:Bow Nomad 2			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:At 2nd level, a bow nomad must select archery as her combat style.
Agile Maneuvers	KEY:BOW NOMAD ~ Agile Maneuvers	SORTKEY:Bow Nomad 3			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Feature.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:At 3rd level, a bow nomad gains Agile Maneuvers as a bonus feat. This replaces Endurance.
Trick Shot		KEY:BOW NOMAD ~ Trick Shot		SORTKEY:Bow Nomad 4 ~ Trick Shot 0	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:A bow nomad can make a number of trick shots per day equal to 1/2 her ranger level + her Dexterity modifier. Unless otherwise noted, making a trick shot is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. This ability replaces favored terrain.	ABILITY:Ranger Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Trick Shot ~ Deflecting Arrow|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=3	ABILITY:Ranger Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Trick Shot ~ Hampering Strike|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=8	ABILITY:Ranger Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Trick Shot ~ Pinning Strike|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=13	ABILITY:Ranger Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Trick Shot ~ Exploit the Gap|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=18
Focused Fire	KEY:BOW NOMAD ~ Focused Fire		SORTKEY:Bow Nomad 5			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:At 6th level, the bow nomad must select the Manyshot feat as her 6th-level combat style feat. In addition to the normal benefit of Manyshot, the bow nomad can specify the bow in her off hands as the source of the second arrow (precision damage and critical damage are still only added once). The bow nomad takes no two-weapon penalties when using this ability, but she cannot use it and Two-Weapon Fighting in the same round. The nomad can still choose to use Manyshot in the normal manner. At 11th and 16th level, the bow nomad can apply this ability to each of her iterative attacks. This ability alters the 6th-level combat style feat and replaces camouflage and hide in plain sight.
# Trick Shots
Deflecting Arrow	KEY:Trick Shot ~ Deflecting Arrow	SORTKEY:Bow Nomad 4 ~ Trick Shot 1	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:At 3rd level, as an immediate action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, a bow nomad can deflect a single ranged attack. This ability functions as the Deflect Arrows feat, except the bow nomad need not have a hand free and can deflect an attack targeting any creature within 30 feet.
Hampering Strike	KEY:Trick Shot ~ Hampering Strike	SORTKEY:Bow Nomad 4 ~ Trick Shot 2	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:At 8th level, a bow nomad can attempt to disarm or trip an opponent within 30 feet in place of a ranged attack, with a -4 penalty on the combat maneuver check.
Pinning Strike	KEY:Trick Shot ~ Pinning Strike	SORTKEY:Bow Nomad 4 ~ Trick Shot 3	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:At 13th level, a bow nomad can attempt to pin a Large or smaller opponent's limb or clothing to the ground or a wall in place of an attack. If the bow nomad's attack roll exceeds her opponent's CMD, the opponent is pinned and cannot move from its current position. As a move action, the opponent can attempt a Strength check to free itself (DC = 10 + 1/2 the bow nomad's ranger level + her Strength modifier). Only creatures adjacent to a solid, anchored, penetrable surface can be affected by this ability.
Exploit the Gap	KEY:Trick Shot ~ Exploit the Gap	SORTKEY:Bow Nomad 4 ~ Trick Shot 4	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:At 18th level, a bow nomad can exploit the natural weaknesses of her foes. When a bow nomad makes a full attack with her twin bows, each arrow that deals damage in that attack also reduces the target's natural armor bonus (if any) by 1 (to a minimum of o) for 1 round.
