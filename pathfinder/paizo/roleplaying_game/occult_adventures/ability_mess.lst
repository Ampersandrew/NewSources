###Block: Wild Talents

Simple Blasts
A kineticist gains a simple blast from
her primary element at 1st level—some
elements offer more than one option.
When a kineticist gains a new element
via the expanded element class feature, she
gains a simple blast from that element
as well. Each simple blast is either
a physical blast or an energy blast.
Physical blasts are ranged attacks
that deal an amount of damage
equal to 1d6+1 + the kineticist’s
Constitution modifier, increasing by
1d6+1 for every 2 kineticist levels
beyond 1st. Spell resistance
doesn’t apply against physical
blasts. Energy blasts are ranged
touch attacks that deal an amount of damage equal
to 1d6 + 1/2 the kineticist’s Constitution modifier,
increasing by 1d6 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st.
AIR BLAST
Element air; Type simple blast (Sp); Level —; Burn 0
Blast Type physical; Damage bludgeoning
You batter a single foe with a gust of air.
COLD BLAST
Element water; Type simple blast (Sp); Level —; Burn 0
Blast Type energy; Damage cold
You emit a beam of utter cold to freeze a single foe.
EARTH BLAST
Element earth; Type simple blast (Sp); Level —; Burn 0
Blast Type physical; Damage bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing
You shape earth into clumps or shards and send them flying at a foe.
ELECTRIC BLAST
Element air; Type simple blast (Sp); Level —; Burn 0
Blast Type energy; Damage electricity
You shoot an arc of electricity to shock a single foe.
FIRE BLAST
Element fire; Type simple blast (Sp); Level —; Burn 0
Blast Type energy; Damage fire
You unleash a gout of flickering fire to burn a single foe.
TELEKINETIC BLAST
Element aether; Type simple blast (Sp); Level —; Burn 0
Blast Type physical; Damage bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing
You throw a nearby unattended object at a single foe as a
ranged attack. The object must weigh no more than 5 pounds
per kineticist level you possess. If the attack hits, the target and
the thrown object each take the blast’s damage. Since the
object is enfolded in strands of aether, even if you use
this power on a magic weapon or other unusual
object, the attack doesn’t use any of the magic
weapon’s bonuses or effects; it simply deals
your blast damage. Alternatively, you can
loosen the strands of aether in order to deal
damage to both the object and the target as
though you had thrown the object yourself
(instead of dealing your normal blast damage).
You substitute your Constitution modifier for your
Strength modifier if throwing the object would
have added your Strength modifier on the
damage roll, and you don’t take the –4 penalty
on the attack roll for throwing an object that
wasn’t designed to be thrown. In this case, the
object’s special effects apply (including effects
from its materials), and if the object is a weapon, you
must be proficient with it and able to wield it with one hand;
otherwise, the item deals damage as a one-handed improvised
weapon for a creature of your size.
WATER BLAST
Element water; Type simple blast (Sp); Level —; Burn 0
Blast Type physical; Damage bludgeoning
You slam a single foe with a stream of water.
Composite Blasts
Composite blasts combine elements to form a new blast. When
a kineticist gains a new element through expanded element,
she gains access to all composite blasts for which she qualifies.
Most composite blasts are either physical or energy blasts,
like simple blasts. Physical composite blasts deal an amount
of damage equal to 2d6+2 + the kineticist’s Constitution
modifier, increasing by 2d6+2 for every 2 kineticist levels
beyond 1st; energy composite blasts deal an amount of damage
equal to 2d6 + 1/2 the kineticist’s Constitution modifier,
increasing by 2d6 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st.
AETHERIC BOOST
Element aether; Type composite blast (Sp); Level —; Burn 2
Prerequisites telekinetic blast, expanded element (any)
Blast Type special; Damage see text
You infuse a simple blast you know with aether, causing it to deal
1 additional point of damage of the same type for each of its
damage dice; it otherwise acts as the simple blast. At 15th level, you
can also infuse a composite blast with aether. To infuse a composite
blast in this way, you must accept 1 additional point of burn.

You batter a single foe with a gust of air crackling with electricity.

# Defense Wild Talents
ENVELOPING WINDS
Element air; Type defense (Su); Level —; Burn 0
You constantly surround yourself with a whirling torrent of air,
crackling arcs of lightning, or both to protect yourself from ranged
attacks. All ranged attacks made with physical weapons suffer a
20% miss chance against you, except for attacks from massive
weapons such as a giant’s thrown boulder or a ballista. This ability
has no effect on ray attacks. The miss chance increases by 5% for
every 5 kineticist levels you possess beyond 2nd. By accepting
1 point of burn, you can increase the miss chance by 5% until the
next time your burn is removed. You can continue to accept points
of burn to increase the miss chance further, up to a maximum of
75%. Whenever you accept burn while using an air wild talent, the
energy surging through you causes your enveloping winds to also affect non-physical ranged attacks such as ray attacks for 1 round.
You can dismiss or restore this effect as an immediate action.

# 17
FLESH OF STONE
Element earth; Type defense (Su); Level —; Burn 0
Your skin hardens like stone, dampening the impact of most
attacks. You gain DR 1/adamantine. This DR increases by 1 for
every 2 kineticist levels you possess beyond 2nd. By accepting
1 point of burn, you can increase the DR by 1 until the next time
your burn is removed, to a maximum DR equal to your kineticist
level. Whenever you accept burn while using an earth wild
talent, the energy surging through you causes your damage
reduction to change from DR/adamantine to DR/— for 1 round.
You can dismiss and restore this effect as an immediate action.
FORCE WARD
Element aether; Type defense (Su); Level —; Burn 0
You constantly surround yourself with a ward of force. You gain
a number of temporary hit points equal to your kineticist level.
You always lose these temporary hit points first, even before other
temporary hit points. If an attack deals less damage than you
still have as temporary hit points from force ward, it still reduces
those temporary hit points but otherwise counts as a miss for the
purpose of abilities that trigger on a hit or a miss. These temporary
hit points regenerate at a rate of 1 per minute. By accepting 1
point of burn as a standard action, you can increase the maximum
number of temporary hit points provided by your force ward by
half your kineticist level until the next time your burn is removed.
If you use this ability multiple times, the increases stack. For every
2 points of burn you accept in this way, your force ward’s rate of
regeneration increases by 1 hit point per minute. Whenever you
accept burn while using an aether wild talent, you siphon some
of the energy from the aether flowing through you and your
force ward recovers a number of temporary hit points equal to
your character level, up to its current maximum. You can dismiss
or restore your force ward as an immediate action, but doing so
doesn’t change the number of temporary hit points available, and
the temporary hit points don’t recover while this ability is inactive.
SEARING FLESH
Element fire; Type defense (Su); Level —; Burn 0
Your body becomes painfully hot. Whenever a creature hits you
with a natural attack or an unarmed strike, that creature takes
1 point of fire damage per 4 kineticist levels you possess (minimum
1 point of fire damage). A creature in a grapple with you takes
double this amount of damage at the end of each of its turns.
Weapons that strike you also take this damage, though the damage
is unlikely to penetrate the weapon’s hardness. By accepting 1 point
of burn, you can increase this damage by 1 point per 4 kineticist
levels you possess until the next time your burn is removed. You
can increase the damage in this way up to seven times.
Whenever you accept burn while using a fire wild talent, the
surging flame causes your searing flesh to deal double its current
amount of damage for 1 round (a creature in a grapple with you
takes a total of four times as much damage as normal). You can
dismiss or restore this effect as an immediate action.
SHROUD OF WATER
Element water; Type defense (Su); Level —; Burn 0
You surround yourself with a shroud of water, ice, or both that
protects you from harm. The shroud can either cover your body,
functioning as armor, or float around you and block attacks,
functioning as a shield. It grants either a +4 armor bonus to AC or
a +2 shield bonus to AC, and you can change the type of bonus as
a standard action. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 kineticist
levels you possess beyond 2nd. By accepting 1 point of burn,
you can increase the bonus by 1 until the next time your burn is
removed. You can increase the bonus multiple times in this way,
but it can’t be increased by more than 50% of its starting value.
When you change the shroud to grant a shield bonus, any bonus
in excess of this limit doesn’t apply, but it remains if you change
the shroud’s bonus type again. Whenever you accept burn while
using a water wild talent, the water coalescing around you
allows your shroud to grant both the armor bonus and the shield
bonus for 1 round. You can dismiss or restore this effect as an
immediate action.

# Infusion Wild Talents
BOWLING INFUSION
Element aether or earth; Type substance infusion; Level 2; Burn 2
Associated Blasts earth, magma, metal, mud, telekinetic
Saving Throw none
You bowl your foes over with the sheer mass of your kinetic blast.
Attempt a trip combat maneuver check against each target damaged
by your infused blast, using your Constitution modifier instead of
your Strength modifier to determine your Combat Maneuver Bonus.
BRILLIANT INFUSION
Element fire; Type substance infusion; Level 6; Burn 4
Prerequisite flash infusion
Associated Blasts blue flame, fire, plasma
Saving Throw none
Your kinetic blast leaves an afterglow that banishes the darkness.
Treat each square of the path of your ranged attack kinetic blast,
the target square of your melee attack kinetic blast, or the area
of your area of effect kinetic blast as the center of a continual
flame effect that lasts until the end of your next turn. This effect
counts as a 6th-level spell with the light descriptor.
BURNING INFUSION
Element fire; Type substance infusion; Level 1; Burn 1
Associated Blasts blue flame, fire, magma, plasma
Saving Throw Reflex negates
Your kinetic blast ignites your foes. Whenever an infused blast
hits a foe and penetrates its spell resistance, that foe catches on
fire, regardless of whether it takes damage. A foe that catches
fire takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is
extinguished. Against a creature on fire from this infusion, any
fire kinetic blasts gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls, to DCs, and on
caster level checks to overcome spell resistance.

# 18
CHAIN
Element air; Type form infusion; Level 5; Burn 3
Associated Blasts electric
Saving Throw none
Your electric blast leaps from target to target. When you hit a target
with your infused blast, you can attempt a ranged touch attack
against an additional target that is within 30 feet of the first. Each
additional attack originates from the previous target, which could
alter cover and other conditions. Each additional target takes
1d6 fewer points of damage than the last (for
example, 3d6 becomes 2d6), and you can’t
chain the blast back to a previous target.
You can continue chaining your blasts until a
blast misses or fails to deal damage, or until
your blast is reduced to a single damage die.
CHILLING INFUSION
Element water; Type substance infusion;
Level 5; Burn 3
Associated Blasts blizzard, cold, ice
Saving Throw Fortitude negates
Your kinetic blast chills your foes to the bone,
making their movements sluggish. Whenever an
infused blast deals cold damage to a foe, that foe is
staggered for 1 round.
CLOUD
Element air or water; Type form infusion; Level 7; Burn 4
Prerequisite extended range
Associated Blasts blizzard, sandstorm, steam, thunderstorm
Saving Throw none
You release your power in a diffuse cloud. You can center
this 20-foot-radius spread anywhere within 120 feet of you.
All creatures and objects within the cloud when you create it
automatically take 1/4 the normal amount of damage from your
blast with no saving throw. Any time a creature enters the cloud,
it takes half the normal amount of damage from your blast, as
do creatures that end their turns in the cloud. Your cloud obscures
vision as obscuring mist. It lasts for a number of rounds equal to
your Constitution modifier or until you use the cloud infusion again.
CYCLONE
Element air; Type form infusion; Level 4; Burn 3
Associated Blasts air, blizzard, sandstorm, thunderstorm
Saving Throw Reflex half
You create a circular rush of wind. All creatures and objects within a
20-foot-radius burst centered on you take half your blast’s normal
amount of damage. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.
DEADLY EARTH
Element earth; Type form infusion; Level 6; Burn 4
Prerequisite extended range
Associated Blasts earth, magma, metal, mud
Saving Throw none
You infuse the ground in a 20-foot radius anywhere within 120 feet
of you on an earthen surface (if you are using a metal blast, this
infusion affects a metal surface instead). The ground roils and
buckles beneath the affected area. All creatures and objects
in contact with the ground within the area when you create it
automatically take 1/4 of the normal damage from your blast with
no saving throw. Any time a creature enters the area, it takes half
the normal damage from your blast, as do creatures that end
their turns in the area. The entire area counts
as difficult terrain. This infusion lasts for a
number of rounds equal to your Constitution
modifier or until you use it again.
DISINTEGRATING INFUSION
Element aether; Type substance infusion;
Level 6; Burn 4
Associated Blasts force
Saving Throw Fortitude partial; see text
You can use force to rip your targets apart. Against
creatures, your kinetic blast deals double its normal
amount of damage, but targets receive a saving throw
to reduce the damage to half the blast’s normal amount
of damage (for a total of 1/4 of the blast’s increased
damage). Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by the
blast is disintegrated, as the spell disintegrate. You can use the
infused blast to destroy force effects or objects as disintegrate,
but for each force effect or 10-foot cube of nonliving matter you
destroy in this way, you must accept 1 point of burn, which can’t be
reduced by effects such as infusion specialization or gather power.
DRAINING INFUSION
Element universal; Type substance infusion; Level 1; Burn 1
Associated Blasts any simple
Saving Throw Fortitude partial; see text
You can drain elemental energy and matter from your foes to
strengthen your next attack. When you use this infusion, your
kinetic blast affects only creatures with a subtype matching your
kinetic blast’s element (for instance, a fire blast would damage
only creatures of the fire subtype). Against such creatures, your
blast targets touch AC (if it requires an attack roll) and always
allows spell resistance. Because you are draining energy from the
target, your blast doesn’t apply your elemental overflow bonuses
or Constitution modifier. The target can attempt a Fortitude save to
take 1/4 the normal amount of damage. Draining infusion ignores any damage reduction, resistances, and immunities the creature
might possess. If at least one creature fails its saving throw against
your draining infusion, you can reduce the total burn cost of any one
blast wild talent used before the end of your next turn by 1, or by
2 if you have the supercharge ability. If you use draining infusion
again before applying this reduction, you still deal the damage
from that draining infusion, but the burn reductions don’t stack.

# 19
ENTANGLING INFUSION
Element earth or water; Type substance infusion; Level 2; Burn 2
Associated Blasts blizzard, cold, earth, ice, magma, metal,
mud, sandstorm
Saving Throw Reflex negates
Your kinetic blast surrounds your foes in elemental matter.
Whenever a blast with this infusion deals damage to a foe, that
foe becomes entangled for 1 minute. The foe can remove this
condition as a standard action with a successful Escape Artist or
Strength check (with the same DC as for saves against your kinetic
blast) or by dealing an amount of damage to the entangling matter
equal to double your kineticist level (the matter has hardness 0).
If the foe was already entangled by this infusion and fails its save
against a second instance of this infusion, the increased amount
of elemental matter fuses to the ground, causing the foe to be
rooted in place as though anchored to an immobile object.
ERUPTION
Element fire; Type form infusion; Level 3; Burn 2
Prerequisite extended range
Associated Blasts blue flame, fire, magma, steam
Saving Throw Reflex half
Your kinetic blast erupts from the ground in a pillar centered
anywhere within 120 feet of you. The pillar affects all creatures
and objects in a 10-foot-radius cylinder that extends 40 feet above
the ground. An energy blast infused with eruption deals its normal
damage to each target, while a physical blast deals half its normal
amount of damage. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.
EXPLOSION
Element fire; Type form infusion; Level 7; Burn 4
Prerequisite extended range
Associated Blasts blue flame, fire
Saving Throw Reflex half
You focus your energy on a point in space and create a controlled
explosion. You can center the explosion anywhere within 120 feet
of you, and you can choose the radius of the spread to be 5, 10, 15,
or 20 feet. All creatures and objects within the explosion take your
blast’s damage. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.
EXTENDED RANGE
Element universal; Type form infusion; Level 1; Burn 1
Associated Blasts any
Saving Throw none
Your kinetic blast can strike any target within 120 feet.
EXTREME RANGE
Element universal; Type form infusion; Level 3; Burn 2
Prerequisite extended range
Associated Blasts any
Saving Throw none
Your kinetic blast can strike any target within 480 feet.
FAN OF FLAMES
Element fire; Type form infusion; Level 1; Burn 1
Associated Blasts blue flame, fire
Saving Throw Reflex half
Your kinetic blast extends in a fan of flames, damaging all
creatures and objects in a 15-foot cone. The saving throw DC is
Dexterity-based.
FLASH INFUSION
Element fire; Type substance infusion; Level 4; Burn 3
Associated Blasts blue flame, fire, plasma
Saving Throw Will negates
Your kinetic blast is so bright that it blinds your foes. Whenever an
infused blast hits a foe and penetrates its spell resistance, that foe
must succeed at a Will save or be blinded for 1 round, regardless
of whether it takes damage from the blast. You can reduce the
blast’s damage by half to increase the DC of this save by 2.
FLURRY OF BLASTS
Element universal; Type form infusion; Level 3; Burn 2
Prerequisite extended range
Associated Blasts any
Saving Throw none
Instead of a single kinetic blast, you shoot two kinetic blasts at
targets within 120 feet that each deal damage as if your kineticist
level were 1st (effects or abilities that increase your kinetic blast’s
damage don’t apply). At 10th level, you can shoot three blasts
with flurry of blasts; this increases to four blasts at 16th level and
to five blasts at 20th level. If you are under the effect of haste
or similar magic that increases your number of attacks in a fullattack
action, the number of kinetic blasts in your flurry of blasts
increases by 1.
No two targets can be more than 30 feet apart. You must assign
the targets of all your blasts before rolling any of the attacks. Any
blast beyond the first that hits the same target adds 1d6 points of
damage; bonuses and penalties to damage don’t apply. If you are
using a substance infusion that requires a saving throw, a target
attempts its save only once (even if it was hit multiple times),
but it takes a penalty on the save equal to the number of times
it was hit beyond the first. If you are using a substance infusion
that requires a caster level check or combat maneuver check, you
roll the check only once against each target, but you gain a bonus
on the check equal to the number of times that target was hit
beyond the first. If you are using the pushing substance infusion,
the maximum distance of the push increases by 5 feet for each
time the target was hit beyond the first.

# 20
FOE THROW
Element aether; Type form infusion; Level 3; Burn 2
Associated Blasts telekinetic
Saving Throw Fortitude negates; see text
Your telekinetic blast can throw a Large or smaller creature instead
of an unattended object; you can increase the burn cost by 1 to
affect a creature of a larger size. If the creature you attempt to
throw succeeds at a Fortitude save, it negates the blast entirely.
Otherwise, if your blast hits, both the thrown creature and the
target take the full amount of damage from your telekinetic blast,
and the thrown creature falls prone in the last unoccupied space
along its path. If your blast misses, the thrown creature can choose
to occupy any space within 30 feet of the target, it doesn’t fall
prone, and it takes half the normal amount of damage from your
blast. The movement doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity.
FORCE HOOK
Element aether; Type form infusion; Level 3; Burn 2
Associated Blasts force
Saving Throw none
Your force blast hooks onto its target and drags you adjacent to
it. This effect functions as force hook chargeUM, except with the
range and damage of your force blast.
FRAGMENTATION
Element earth or water; Type form infusion; Level 7; Burn 4
Prerequisite extended range
Associated Blasts earth, ice, metal
Saving Throw none or Reflex half; see text
You throw a volatile sphere of solid matter that shatters into
countless shards. Attempt a ranged attack roll against a target
within 120 feet. If you hit, the target takes your kinetic blast
damage with no saving throw. All other creatures and objects
within a 20-foot burst take half the normal amount of damage
and can attempt a Reflex save to reduce that damage by half
again. If the attack misses its target, the blast has no effect. The
saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.
GRAPPLING INFUSION
Element universal; Type substance infusion; Level 5; Burn 3
Associated Blasts any
Saving Throw none
Your cloud, deadly earth, or wall blast grows tendrils that hold
your enemies in place. Whenever a creature takes damage from
the infused blast, you can attempt a combat maneuver check to
have the blast grapple that opponent. Your bonus on this check is
equal to 2 + your kineticist level + your Constitution modifier (treat
the blast as a Huge creature). The blast only grapples opponents;
it can’t perform other functions of grapple maneuvers such as
pinning or moving the opponent. If the blast is already grappling
an opponent, it receives a +5 bonus on its combat maneuver check
to maintain the grapple, as normal. You can use this infusion only
if you also use the cloud, deadly earth, or wall form infusion.
GUSTING INFUSION
Element air; Type substance infusion; Level 1; Burn 1
Associated Blasts air, blizzard, sandstorm, thunderstorm
Saving Throw Fortitude negates
The wind from your infusion causes your blast to act as an
instantaneous gust of wind. If your blast has a clear path, you can
accept 2 additional points of burn or reduce the damage to 0 in order
to cause the gust of wind effect to persist for 1 round along that path.
IMPALE
Element earth or water; Type form infusion; Level 3; Burn 2
Associated Blasts earth, ice, metal
Saving Throw none
You extend a long, sharp spike of elemental matter along a line,
impaling multiple foes. Make a single attack roll against each
creature or object in a 30-foot line, starting with the closest
target. If the result is a critical threat, roll to confirm against only
the first target you hit. Calculate damage against each target you
hit, starting from the closest. If your attack hits a target but fails
to deal physical damage to that target, the spike fails to penetrate
and the infused blast doesn’t continue. A blast with the impale
infusion can penetrate solid barriers, but it must deal enough
damage to destroy the barrier in order to continue through. Infused
earth and metal blasts always deal piercing damage.
KINETIC BLADE
Element universal; Type form infusion; Level 1; Burn 1
Associated Blasts any
Saving Throw none
You form a weapon using your kinetic abilities. You create a nonreach,
light or one-handed weapon in your hand formed of pure
energy or elemental matter. (If you’re a telekineticist, you instead
transfer the power of your kinetic blast to any object held in one
hand.) The kinetic blade’s shape is purely cosmetic and doesn’t
affect the damage dice, critical threat range, or critical multiplier
of the kinetic blade, nor does it grant the kinetic blade any weapon
special features. The object held by a telekineticist for this form
infusion doesn’t prevent her from using gather power.
You can use this form infusion once as part of an attack action,
a charge action, or a full-attack action in order to make melee
attacks with your kinetic blade. Since it’s part of another action
(and isn’t an action itself), using this wild talent doesn’t provoke
any additional attacks of opportunity. The kinetic blade deals
your kinetic blast damage on each hit (applying any modifiers
to your kinetic blast’s damage as normal, but not your Strength
modifier). The blade disappears at the end of your turn. The
weapon deals the same damage type that your kinetic blast
deals, and it interacts with Armor Class and spell resistance as
normal for a blast of its type. Even if a telekineticist uses this
power on a magic weapon or another unusual object, the attack
doesn’t use any of the magic weapon’s bonuses or effects and
simply deals the telekineticist’s blast damage. The kinetic blade
doesn’t add the damage bonus from elemental overflow.

# 21
KINETIC FIST
Element universal; Type form infusion; Level 1; Burn 1
Associated Blasts any
Saving Throw none
You surround your body with energy or elemental matter from
your kinetic abilities. You can use this form infusion as part of
an attack action, a charge action, or a full-attack action to add
damage to each of your natural attacks and unarmed strikes
until the beginning of your next turn. Since kinetic fist is part
of another action, using this wild talent doesn’t provoke any
additional attack of opportunity. You deal an additional 1d6
points of damage per 3 dice of your kinetic blast’s damage
(minimum 1d6), and this damage is of the same type
as your kinetic blast’s damage. This extra damage
ignores spell resistance and doesn’t apply any
modifiers to your kinetic blast’s damage, such
as your Constitution modifier.
KINETIC WHIP
Element universal; Type form
infusion; Level 3; Burn 2
Prerequisite kinetic blade
Associated Blasts any
Saving Throw none
You form a long tendril of energy or
elemental matter. This functions as kinetic
blade but counts as a reach weapon appropriate
for your size. Unlike most reach weapons, the
kinetic whip can also attack nearby creatures. The
kinetic whip disappears at the beginning of your
next turn, but in the intervening time, it threatens all squares
within its reach, allowing you to make attacks of opportunity
that deal the whip’s usual damage.
MAGNETIC INFUSION
Element air or earth; Type substance infusion; Level 3; Burn 2
Associated Blasts charged water, electric, metal, plasma,
thunderstorm
Saving Throw none
Your kinetic blast causes your foes to become mildly magnetic.
Whenever an infused blast deals damage to a foe, attacks made
with metal weapons (including metal kinetic blasts) against
that foe receive a +4 bonus until the end of your next turn, and
the foe takes a –4 penalty on Reflex saving throws to avoid
metallic objects.
MANY THROW
Element aether; Type form infusion; Level 8; Burn 4
Prerequisite extended range
Associated Blasts telekinesis
Saving Throw none
You grab a large number of objects and throw them all at once.
You can use your telekinetic blast to make attack rolls against a
number of targets equal to your kineticist level within 120 feet,
but no two targets can be more than 30 feet apart.
MOBILE BLAST
Element universal; Type form infusion; Level 3; Burn 2
Associated Blasts any
Saving Throw Reflex negates
You send an elemental mass, energy ball, or object into a
particular square within 30 feet, dealing 1/4 the normal
amount of damage (or half the normal amount of damage,
for an energy blast) to all creatures in that square. The mobile
blast lasts until you dismiss it as a free action,
lose consciousness, or move farther than 30
feet from it. Each round on your turn as a
move action, you can move the mobile
blast to another square within range;
either way, it continues to deal
damage to all creatures in its final
square each round if they
fail their saving throws.
You can have only a single
mobile blast in existence at
a time. If the mobile blast’s total burn
cost before applying any reduction for gather
power is 0, it has no maximum duration. Otherwise,
it lasts for a maximum number of rounds equal to your
Constitution modifier, and afterward you can’t create another
mobile blast for a number of minutes equal to the number of
rounds it existed. A mobile blast is always extremely loud and
visible. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.
PURE-FLAME INFUSION
Element fire; Type substance infusion; Level 7; Burn 4
Associated Blasts blue flame
Saving Throw none
You open a direct conduit to the purest elemental fire and send it
surging forth. Your infused blast ignores spell resistance.
PUSHING INFUSION
Element aether, air, earth, or water; Type substance infusion;
Level 1; Burn 1
Associated Blasts air, blizzard, charged water, earth, magma,
metal, mud, sandstorm, steam, telekinetic, water
Saving Throw none
The momentum of your kinetic blast knocks foes back. Attempt a
bull rush combat maneuver check against each target damaged
by your infused blast, using your Constitution modifier instead
of your Strength modifier to determine your bonus. This infusion
can push a foe back by a maximum of 5 feet. You can increase
the burn cost of this infusion to increase the maximum distance
pushed by 5 feet per additional point of burn accepted. You can’t
use this infusion with a form infusion such as cloud that causes
your kinetic blast to lack a clear direction to push.

# 22
QUENCHING INFUSION
Element water; Type substance infusion; Level 1; Burn 1
Associated Blasts charged water, water
Saving Throw none
Your blast puts out nonmagical fires as if they had been touched
by a water elemental. If you increase the burn cost to 2 or
reduce the damage to 0, it also dispels magical fires as if you
were a water elemental with a number of Hit Dice equal to your
kineticist level.
RARE-METAL INFUSION
Element earth; Type substance infusion; Level 3; Burn 2
Associated Blasts metal
Saving Throw none
You can control the properties of metal, allowing your metal
blast to bypass damage reduction as if it were adamantine, cold
iron, or silver (your choice). If your target has an unusual type of
damage reduction that could be overcome with the correct type
of metal (such as DR/gold), you can also select that metal for this
purpose. The metal you create with this infusion crumbles away
shortly thereafter and has no gp value.
SNAKE
Element universal; Type form infusion; Level 3; Burn 2
Prerequisite extended range
Associated Blasts any
Saving Throw none
You have fine control over your kinetic blast, allowing you to alter
its path to avoid obstacles. You can trace out any path no more
than 120 feet long for your blast, potentially allowing you to avoid
cover (even total cover). You can choose a path that leads into
squares you cannot see.
SPRAY
Element water; Type form infusion; Level 4; Burn 3
Associated Blasts charged water, water
Saving Throw Reflex half
You diffuse your kinetic blast to spray out wildly. All creatures
and objects in a 30-foot cone take half your normal amount of
blast damage. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.
THUNDERING INFUSION
Element air; Type substance infusion; Level 1; Burn 1
Associated Blasts electric, thunderstorm
Saving Throw Fortitude negates
Your lightning brings with it a peal of thunder. Whenever your
infused blast hits a foe and penetrates spell resistance, that foe
becomes deafened, even if the blast doesn’t deal damage.
TORRENT
Element air, fire, or water; Type form infusion; Level 3; Burn 2
Associated Blasts air, blizzard, blue flame, charged water, fire,
magma, mud, plasma, sandstorm, steam, thunderstorm, water
Saving Throw Reflex half
A torrent of energy buffets or burns all foes in a 30-foot line,
dealing half your normal amount of blast damage (or full damage
for energy blasts). The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.
UNRAVELING INFUSION
Element fire; Type substance infusion; Level 5; Burn 3
Associated Blasts blue flame, fire
Saving Throw none
Your kinetic blast burns so hot that it melts away your foe’s magical
effects. Whenever your infused blast hits a foe and penetrates
its spell resistance, you can attempt a caster level check as if
using a targeted dispel magic before determining whether the
foe takes damage from the blast. You can choose to reduce the
blast’s damage by half to increase your bonus on the caster level
check by 2. If you don’t choose a specific spell effect to attempt
to dispel, you automatically attempt to dispel effects that would
protect the target from fire damage before other spells.
WALL
Element universal; Type form infusion; Level 5; Burn 3
Associated Blasts any
Saving Throw none
You create a wall of churning elements, flensing debris, or roiling
energy. The wall appears within 30 feet and can be either up to 10
feet high and up to 120 feet long or up to 20 feet high and up to
60 feet long. All creatures and objects in one of the wall’s squares
when you create it take 1/4 the normal damage from your blast with
no saving throw (or half the normal damage for an energy blast).
Anytime a creature crosses the wall, it takes half the normal damage
from your blast (or full damage for an energy blast). The wall is not
completely solid, but it does provide cover against attacks from the
other side of the wall. The wall lasts for a number of rounds equal
to your Constitution modifier or until you use a wall infusion again.

# Utility Wild Talents
AERIAL ADAPTATION
Element air; Type utility (Sp); Level 1; Burn 0
You are immune to altitude sickness, and gain an amount of
electricity resistance equal to twice your current amount of burn.
AERIAL EVASION
Element air; Type utility (Su); Level 3; Burn 1
Prerequisite enveloping winds
You use wind to buffet yourself away from area attacks. Until the
next time your burn is removed, you gain evasion, as the rogue
class feature.
AETHER PUPPET
Element aether; Type utility (Sp); Level 5; Burn 0
You use strands of aether to animate an object. You can animate
a Medium or smaller object as an animated object (Pathfinder
RPG Bestiary 14) with no Construction Point abilities (except for
stone or metal [common], if the object is constructed of one of
those materials). Each round on your turn, you must take a move
action to guide the object, or it reverts to its inanimate state.
By accepting 1 point of burn, you can pour a bit of your own
sentience into the aether puppet, allowing the effect to persist
for 1 round per kineticist level without requiring additional
actions. At 12th level, you can animate a Large or smaller object,
which gains all the abilities of the Medium animated object plus
the additional attack ability. At 14th level, you can animate a
Huge or smaller object, which gains all the abilities of the Large
animated object. At 16th level, you can animate a Gargantuan or
smaller object, which gains all the abilities of the Huge animated
object, as well as the metal (mithral) ability if the object is made
of mithral. At 18th level, you can animate a Colossal or smaller
object, which gains all the abilities of the Gargantuan animated
object, plus the metal (adamantine) ability if the object is made
of adamantine.

# 23
AIR CUSHION
Element air; Type utility (Sp); Level 1; Burn 0
You cushion a fall from any height. You are constantly under the
effects of feather fall, and you count as one size category larger
for the purpose of determining how you are affected by wind.
AIR SHROUD
Element air; Type utility (Sp); Level 1; Burn 0
You are always surrounded by air, as air bubbleUC. As a standard
action, you can accept 1 point of burn to extend the effect to a
number of additional creatures equal to your Constitution modifier
for 1 minute per kineticist level you possess.
AIR SHROUD, GREATER
Element air; Type utility (Sp); Level 5; Burn 0
Prerequisite air shroud
Your air shroud improves, granting you the benefits of life
bubbleAPG. When you accept burn to grant the benefit to others,
the benefit lasts until the next time your burn is removed.
AIR’S LEAP
Element air; Type utility (Su); Level 1; Burn 0
You are always considered to have a running start when jumping,
you add your kineticist level as a bonus on all Acrobatics checks
to jump, you jump twice as far or high as the results of your check
indicate, and you can accept 1 point of burn when jumping to
double the distance you jump again (to a total of four times as far).
AIR’S REACH
Element air; Type utility (Su); Level 1; Burn —
When using air blasts, air wild talents, or composite blasts that
include air, double the blast’s effective range. This effect applies
after altering the range due to effects such as the extended range
infusion. This doubles only the blast’s effective range, not the area
of effect for infusions like cloud and cyclone.
BASIC AEROKINESIS
Element air; Type utility (Sp); Level 1; Burn 0
You can create a light breeze that blows against a creature or
object from a direction of your choice that follows the target
wherever it goes. The breeze grants the subject a +2 bonus on
saves against very hot conditions, severe heat, breath weapons,
and cloud vapors and gases (such as cloudkill, stinking cloud,
and inhaled poisons). This wild talent doesn’t function without
air or while underwater. You can have only one such breeze
active at any one time.
You can also use your aerokinesis to make it harder to detect
you or others by scent. You can designate a number of creatures
or objects equal to your Constitution bonus. These creatures
and objects always count as being downwind for the purpose
of determining the distance at which they can be detected by
scent. This effect lasts for 1 hour or until you use basic aerokinesis
again, whichever comes first.
BASIC GEOKINESIS
Element earth; Type utility (Sp); Level 1; Burn 0
You can move up to 5 pounds per kineticist level of rocks, loose
earth, sand, clay, and other similar materials up to 15 feet as a
move action. You can search earthen and stone areas from a
distance as if using the siftAPG cantrip.
BASIC HYDROKINESIS
Element water; Type utility (Sp); Level 1; Burn 0
You can create water as the cantrip create water, purify water as
if using purify food and drink, and dry wet creatures and objects
as if using prestidigitation. While you cannot lift water into the
air using this ability, you can create mild currents in a body of
water by concentrating. These currents are strong enough to
run a water mill as if the mill were being turned manually by a
creature with a Strength score equal to your Constitution score.
BASIC PYROKINESIS
Element fire; Type utility (Sp); Level 1; Burn 0
You can use your inner flame to reproduce the effects of a flare,
light, or sparkAPG cantrip, except that the light you create with light
produces heat like a normal flame; using any of the three abilities
ends any previous light effect from this wild talent.
BASIC TELEKINESIS
Element aether; Type utility (Sp); Level 1; Burn 0
This ability is similar to mage hand, except you can move an
object that weighs up to 5 pounds per 2 kineticist levels you
possess (minimum 5 pounds), and you can move magical
objects. Additionally, you can create a container of entwined
strands of aether in order to hold liquids or piles of small objects of the same weight. You can dip the container to pick up or drop
a liquid as a move action. If you possess the extended range
wild talent, you can increase the range of basic telekinesis to
medium range and increase the rate of movement to 30 feet
per round, and if you possess the extreme range wild talent,
you can increase the range of basic telekinesis to long range and
increase the rate of movement to 60 feet per round. You can also
use your basic telekinesis to duplicate the effects of the open/
close cantrip.

# 24
CELERITY
Element air; Type utility (Sp); Level 3; Burn 0
You can galvanize the flow of electricity within
your allies to enhance their speed. This acts
as haste except it lasts for 1 round. You can
accept 1 point of burn to increase the
duration to 1 round per kineticist level
you possess.
COLD ADAPTATION
Element fire or water; Type
utility (Sp); Level 1; Burn 0
You are constantly protected by endure
elements against cold temperatures only.
You gain cold resistance equal to twice your
current amount of burn.
COLD SNAP
Element water; Type utility (Sp); Level 3; Burn 1
Prerequisites cold adaptation, shroud of water
You chill your shroud of water and send the cold around you,
creating an aura of numbing cold around yourself. Until the next
time your burn is removed, you can begin or end the cold aura
at will as a swift action. The temperature in the area 30 feet
around you lowers by 5° F per kineticist level you possess,
to a minimum modified temperature of –10° F. If this brings
the temperature in the area below 40° F, all creatures within
5 feet of you take a –4 penalty to Dexterity. You are immune to
these effects, as are creatures that are immune to cold or that
benefit from effects that protect against temperature, such as
endure elements.
EARTH CLIMB
Element earth; Type utility (Su); Level 2; Burn 0
You use your connection to earth to meld slightly into stone and
earthen surfaces, granting you a climb speed equal to your base
land speed when climbing such surfaces.
EARTH GLIDE
Element earth; Type utility (Su); Level 5; Burn 0
Prerequisite earth climb
You can glide through earth, as an earth elemental’s earth glide
ability, with a burrow speed equal to your base land speed.
EARTH WALK
Element earth; Type utility (Su); Level 1; Burn —
Because you meld very slightly into the earth, when you are
standing on an earthen surface, you ignore difficult terrain caused
by rocks, earth, or mud, and while on such surfaces you add your
elemental overflow bonus to your CMD against being moved or
tripped and on Acrobatics checks to balance.
ELEMENTAL GRIP
Element universal; Type utility (Sp); Level 3; Burn 0
Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes
You use your element to halt a creature associated
with your element, as hold monster except it requires
concentration to maintain, and it works only on
creatures with a subtype matching one of your
elements (for example, a pyrokineticist could
use it on creatures of the fire subtype). At
any time, you can accept 1 point of burn to
remove the need to concentrate.
ENDURING EARTH
Element earth; Type utility (Su); Level 4;
Burn —
When using earth blasts, earth wild talents,
or composite blasts that include earth, double
the duration if it’s longer than 1 round.
ENGULFING WINDS
Element air; Type utility (Sp); Level 3; Burn 0
Prerequisite enveloping winds
You bend your winds into a formidable barrier. Until the start of
your next turn, you lose the benefits of enveloping winds, but can
create a wind wall as the spell. You can extend the wall’s duration
to 1 round per kineticist level by accepting 1 point of burn.
EXPANDED DEFENSE
Element universal; Type utility (Su); Level 4; Burn —
Choose an element you selected with expanded element. You
gain that element’s defense wild talent. You can take this wild
talent multiple times, choosing a different element each time.
FIRE SCULPTOR
Element fire; Type utility (Sp); Level 1; Burn 0
You can sculpt shapes out of flame or alter a fire’s spread. As a
standard action, you can move one 5-foot square of an ongoing fire
per kineticist level you possess to any square contiguous to that
fire. For instance, a 4th-level kineticist could move 4 contiguous
squares from the center of a 20-foot-by-20-foot fire to the fire’s
edge in order to create a safe path to escape. The fire continues
to spread normally after you sculpt it.
FIRE’S FURY
Element fire; Type utility (Su); Level 1; Burn —
When using fire blasts or composite blasts that include fire, add
your elemental overflow bonus to the damage dealt. If the kinetic
blast normally adds double your elemental overflow bonus to
damage, these effects stack.

# 25
FIRESIGHT
Element fire; Type utility (Su); Level 3; Burn —
You can see through flames and smoke as if they were transparent.
Creatures that are on fire or have the fire subtype never benefit
from concealment or total concealment against you.
FLAME JET
Element fire; Type utility (Sp); Level 3; Burn 0
You shoot a burst of flame behind you as a standard action,
propelling you up to 60 feet in a straight line, including into the
air; any movement upward costs double. If you end your turn
mid-air, you fall on your next turn unless you use flame jet again.
FLAME JET, GREATER
Element fire; Type utility (Sp); Level 5; Burn 0
Prerequisite flame jet
You can use flame jet as a move action and can emanate a mild
jet of flame, allowing you to hover without spending an action.
FLAME SHIELD
Element fire; Type utility (Sp); Level 5; Burn 1
Prerequisite searing flesh
Flickering flames surround you until the next time your burn is
removed. While your searing flesh infusion is active, any creature
that strikes you with a melee attack takes an amount of fire
damage equal to 1/2 your kineticist level unless it is using a reach
weapon. If the creature also takes damage from your searing
flesh, it applies fire resistance only once against the total damage
from both effects. You also gain the protection from cold of a
warm fire shield. An attack that would deal an amount of cold
damage equal to at least double your kineticist level (before you
applied the protection) freezes away your flame shield after you
apply its protection, ending the flame shield early.
FORCE BARRIER
Element aether; Type utility (Sp); Level 5; Burn 0
Prerequisite force ward
You create an immobile sphere or hemisphere of force around
your square or squares. The force barrier functions as a wall
of force in all other ways. Activating this ability is a standard
action, and the barrier lasts until the beginning of your next
turn. Each round, just before the barrier would disappear, you
can extend its duration by accepting 1 point of burn. If an attack
manages to destroy the force barrier, you immediately take 1
point of burn.
FROM THE ASHES
Element fire; Type utility (Sp); Level 9; Burn 2
When you are about to fall unconscious or die from hit point
damage, as an immediate action you can burst into flames that
leave behind only ash, which cannot be appreciably affected by
most attacks or effects, though a disintegrate spell or similar
magic can annihilate it. At the start of your next turn, unless
the ash has been completely destroyed, you arise in the square
where the most ash is located, having taken the damage from
the triggering effect but having also healed 5 points of damage
per kineticist level you possess.
HEAT ADAPTATION
Element fire or water; Type utility (Sp); Level 1; Burn 0
You are constantly protected by endure elements against hot
temperatures only. You gain an amount of fire resistance equal
to twice your current amount of burn.
HEAT WAVE
Element fire; Type utility (Sp); Level 3; Burn 1
Prerequisites heat adaptation, searing flesh
You create an aura of shimmering heat that distorts the area
around you. Until the next time your burn is removed, you can
begin or end the heat aura as a swift action. The temperature
in the area 30 feet around you rises by 5° F per kineticist level
you possess, to a maximum modified temperature of 120° F. If
this brings the temperature to at least 90° F, all attacks made
by creatures within 5 feet of you suffer a 20% miss chance due
to concealment. You are immune to these effects, as are those
immune to fire or benefiting from endure elements.
ICE PATH
Element water; Type utility (Su); Level 6; Burn 0
Prerequisite icewalker
You freeze water vapor in the air, allowing you to travel above the
ground as air walk by walking along the ice, and leaving a path
of ice behind you that lasts for 1 round before it melts.
ICE SCULPTOR
Element water; Type utility (Sp); Level 4; Burn 0
You can sculpt ice and snow into new shapes, as the spell stone
shape but affecting ice and snow instead of stone.
ICEWALKER
Element water; Type utility (Su); Level 1; Burn —
You can move across wet and icy surfaces without needing to
attempt Acrobatics checks due to slipperiness, including across
areas under the effects of the slick wild talent. Additionally, you
are immune to seasickness.
JAGGED FLESH
Element earth; Type utility (Sp); Level 3; Burn 1
Prerequisite flesh of stone
You painfully push forth jagged chunks of rock from your flesh.
Until the next time your burn is removed, while your flesh of stone is active, any creature that strikes you with an unarmed
strike or natural weapon or that grapples you takes 1d6 points
of piercing damage. Weapons that strike you also take this
damage, though the damage is unlikely to penetrate the
weapon’s hardness.

# 26
KINETIC COVER
Element aether, earth, or water; Type utility (Sp); Level 1; Burn 0
You call up elemental matter to defend yourself and your allies
from attacks. As a standard action, you can select one face of a
square within 30 feet of you and move elemental matter to block
that face, providing total cover from that direction. The face you
select must be supported by the ground, and the kinetic cover
cannot support more than 5 pounds of weight. Water, ice, and
telekinetic force are translucent, but earth, metal, mud, and the
like are opaque and block line of sight. A creature who strikes
the cover can easily destroy it. Regardless of its composition, the
cover has hardness 0, AC 5, and 2 hit points per kineticist level
you possess. You can have a number of kinetic covers in existence
equal to your Constitution modifier + 1/2 your kineticist level.
KINETIC FORM
Element universal; Type utility (Sp); Level 5; Burn 1
You are able to suspend your body in a large mass of elemental
matter. Until the next time your burn is removed, you can change
your size to Large or shift back to your original size as a standard
action. This doesn’t change your ability scores in any way. At
16th level, you can accept 1 additional point of burn to instead
change your size to Huge. You cannot use kinetic form to decrease
your size.
KINETIC HEALER
Element aether or water; Type utility (Sp); Level 1; Burn 1; see text
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance yes
With a touch, you can heal a willing living creature of an amount
of damage equal to your kinetic blast’s damage. Instead of
paying the burn cost yourself, you can cause the recipient to
take 1 point of burn. If you do so, the recipient takes 1 point of
nonlethal damage per Hit Die he possesses, as usual for burn;
this damage can’t be healed by any means until the recipient
takes a full night’s rest.
REVERSE SHIFT
Element universal; Type utility (Sp); Level 8; Burn 0
You reverse the flow of your connection to the planes, sending
your body into the Ethereal Plane as ethereal jaunt. As long as
you concentrate on reverse shift, you remain on the Ethereal
Plane; after a number of consecutive rounds spent on the Ethereal
Plane equal to your kineticist level (and every such interval
thereafter), you must accept 1 point of burn. Once you return
to the Material Plane, you cannot use reverse shift again for a
number of rounds equal to the number of rounds you spent on
the Ethereal Plane.
RIDE THE BLAST
Element universal; Type utility (Sp); Level 6; Burn 0
You can use this wild talent as part of activating a kinetic blast other
than telekinetic blast. You transform yourself into your element
or energy and send yourself along with your kinetic blast. You
appear at the end of the blast’s path, adjacent to the blast’s target
(or final target, for form infusions like chain) or at the center of
the burst or spread for form infusions like explosion. This ability
doesn’t work with form infusions that involve melee attacks
(such as kinetic blade) or that use a cone shape (such as spray).
SEARING FLAME
Element fire; Type utility (Su); Level 2; Burn —
Prerequisite burning infusion
Over time, your burning infusion sears away your foe’s fire
resistance. When you roll burn damage from burning infusion
against a foe, decrease the foe’s fire resistance by an amount equal
to the unmodified burn damage; don’t apply fire resistance to this
roll for the purpose of determining the reduction. This decrease
lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your kineticist level.
These decreases stack, to a minimum resistance of 0.
SEISMIC MASTER
Element earth; Type utility (Sp); Level 9; Burn 0
You can focus on your connection to earth and create a localized
tremor, as the earthquake spell.
SELF TELEKINESIS
Element aether; Type utility (Sp); Level 3; Burn 0
You use your telekinetic abilities to move yourself. Otherwise,
this wild talent functions like flame jet.
SELF TELEKINESIS, GREATER
Element aether; Type utility (Sp); Level 5; Burn 0
Prerequisite self telekinesis
You have greater control over your self telekinesis. Otherwise,
this wild talent functions like greater flame jet.
SHIFT EARTH
Element earth; Type utility (Sp); Level 4; Burn 0
Prerequisite kinetic cover
Saving Throw see text; Spell Resistance no
As a standard action, you can push or pull a 5-foot cube of earth
or unworked stone within 30 feet, moving the cube 5 feet in any
direction. You can create raised platforms, stairs up a cliff, holes,
or other useful features. This doesn’t cause the earth to float in the
air, although in areas with plenty of earth, you can move a cube
upward, creating a short pillar. If you move the earth beneath a
creature’s feet, it can attempt a DC 20 Reflex save to leap elsewhere
and avoid moving along with the earth.
SHIFT EARTH, GREATER
Element earth; Type utility (Sp); Level 7; Burn 0
Prerequisites kinetic cover, shift earth
You can move greater quantities of earth, as the spell move earth.

# 27
SHIMMERING MIRAGE
Element water; Type utility (Sp); Level 5; Burn 1
Prerequisite shroud of water
Your shroud bends light, creating a shimmering mirage. While
your shroud of water is active, attacks against you suffer a 20%
miss chance due to concealment until the next time your burn
is removed.
SKILLED KINETICIST
Element universal; Type utility (Su); Level 1; Burn —
You gain a bonus equal to 1/2 your kineticist level on skill checks
with the skills your primary element added to your class skill
list, and you can use the Knowledge skill
associated with your primary element
to identify elementals of your primary
element’s subtype.
SKILLED KINETICIST, GREATER
Element universal; Type utility
(Su); Level 2; Burn —
Prerequisite skilled
kineticist
By delving into study of the
Ethereal and Elemental Planes, you are able to
use your primary element to assist with your skills in an
unusual way. Add Knowledge (planes) to your list of class skills.
Choose one of your kineticist class skills that wasn’t granted by your
primary element to also receive the bonus from skilled kineticist.
SLICK
Element water; Type utility (Sp); Level 1; Burn 0
Saving Throw Reflex negates; Spell Resistance no
As a standard action, you call forth slippery water or ice, creating
any of the effects of the grease spell for 1 round. You can accept
1 point of burn at the start of your next turn to extend the duration
to 1 minute per kineticist level you possess.
SMOKE STORM
Element fire; Type utility (Sp); Level 3; Burn 0
Saving Throw Fortitude negates; see text; Spell Resistance no
You transform a source of open flame within 120 feet into a cloud
of choking smoke, filling a 20-foot-radius spread and affecting
vision like a smokestick. All creatures that begin their turns inside
the area become sickened as long as they remain in the smoke
and for 1d4+1 rounds thereafter (Fortitude negates).
SPARK OF LIFE
Element universal; Type utility (Sp); Level 5; Burn 0
You breathe a semblance of life into elemental matter, which
takes the form of a Medium elemental of any of your elements
as if summoned by summon monster IV with a caster level equal
to your kineticist level, except the elemental gains the mindless
trait. Each round on your turn, you must take a move action to
guide the elemental or it collapses back into its component
element. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can pour a bit of
your own sentience into the elemental, removing the mindless
quality and allowing it to persist for 1 round per kineticist level
without requiring any further actions. At 12th level, you can
choose to form a Large elemental as if by summon monster V;
at 14th level, you can choose to form a Huge elemental as if
by summon monster VI; at 16th level, you can choose to form
a greater elemental as if by summon monster VII; and at 18th
level, you can choose to form an elder elemental as if by summon
monster VIII.
SPELL DEFLECTION
Element aether; Type utility (Sp);
Level 7; Burn 0
You weave strands of aether around
yourself in order to deflect targeted
magic back at the caster. Until the
beginning of your next turn, every
time you are targeted by a spell that
could be affected by spell turning, roll
1d10–1 and determine the effects of the
spell as if you had spell turning with that
many spell levels remaining. You can accept
1 point of burn to increase the duration to 10 minutes
per kineticist level you possess, but in that case, it deflects
only 10 spell levels in total (still rolled 1d10–1 at a time) before
ending early.
STONE SCULPTOR
Element earth; Type utility (Sp); Level 5; Burn 0
You can sculpt earth into any shape, as the spell stone shape.
SUFFOCATE
Elements aether, air, or water; Type utility (Sp); Level 6; Burn 0
Saving Throw Fortitude partial; Spell Resistance yes
You use aether to choke a creature within 120 feet, air to create an
area of unbreathable air around it, or water to fill its throat with
water. If your target needs to breathe, it must hold its breath for
as long as you concentrate. On each of its turns, it can attempt a
Fortitude save in order to speak, but it can breathe only if your
concentration breaks, you leave the 120-foot range, or you break
line of effect. You can accept 1 point of burn when activating this
wild talent in order to expel the air from your target’s lungs. If
you do so and the target fails its first Fortitude save, it becomes
disabled and is reduced to 0 hit points, and on its second failed
Fortitude save, it falls unconscious and is reduced to –1 hit points.
TELEKINETIC DEFLECTION
Element aether; Type utility (Sp); Level 8; Burn 0
You can deflect your foes’ attacks, as the spell deflectionAPG with
a duration of 1 round. You can accept 1 point of burn to increase
the duration to 1 round per kineticist level you possess.

# 28
TELEKINETIC FINESSE
Element aether; Type utility (Sp); Level 1; Burn 0
You can perform any sort of fine manipulation you choose within
close range, including attempting Sleight of Hand and Disable
Device checks.
TELEKINETIC GLOBE
Element aether; Type utility (Sp); Level 8; Burn 0
Prerequisites force barrier, force ward
You can create a globe of force, as the telekinetic sphere spell,
that lasts as long as you concentrate as a standard action, and you
can move the globe as a move action. You can accept 1 point of
burn to increase the duration to 1 minute per level and eliminate
the need to concentrate to maintain the globe.
TELEKINETIC HAUL
Element aether; Type utility (Sp); Level 2; Burn 0
Prerequisite basic telekinesis
When using basic telekinesis, you can move an object that
weighs up to 100 pounds per kineticist level you possess. When
using your telekinetic blast, you can throw an object weighing
up to 100 pounds per kineticist level you possess, but this
doesn’t increase the damage. If you accept 1 point of burn,
the maximum weight increases to 1,000 pounds per kineticist
level you possess and the duration increases to 1 minute per
kineticist level you possess.
TELEKINETIC INVISIBILITY
Element aether; Type utility (Sp); Level 3; Burn 0
You weave strands of aether, bending light and dampening sound;
this works as invisibility except that the aetheric bending is
easier to notice than normal invisibility, so your bonus on Stealth
checks is halved (+10 while moving and +20 while perfectly still).
However, the dampened sound allows you to avoid automatic
detection via sound-based blindsense and blindsight, but you
do not receive the bonus on Stealth checks from this wild talent
against a creature with such abilities.
TELEKINETIC MANEUVERS
Element aether; Type utility (Sp); Level 4; Burn 0
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance yes
You can perform combat maneuvers as telekinesis, but you use
your Constitution modifier to determine your Combat Maneuver
Bonus rather than your Intelligence or Charisma modifier. If you
possess the telekinetic finesse wild talent, add dirty trick and
steal combat maneuvers to the list of combat maneuvers you can
perform; when performing these maneuvers, determine your
Combat Maneuver Bonus using your Dexterity modifier instead
of your Constitution modifier.
TIDAL WAVE
Element water; Type utility (Sp); Level 9; Burn 1
You call forth a powerful tidal wave, as tsunamiAPG.
TOUCHSIGHT
Element aether; Type utility (Su); Level 3; Burn 0
You attach strands of aether to everything your telekinesis touches.
Any time you damage a creature using your telekinetic blast, as
long as that creature doesn’t use a teleportation effect, you can
see that creature at any distance as if using blindsight until the
end of your next turn. Immediately after damaging a creature,
you can accept 1 point of burn to strengthen the strands of aether
attached to that creature, increasing the duration of the touchsight
on that creature to 1 round per kineticist level.
TOUCHSIGHT, REACTIVE
Element aether; Type utility (Su); Level 5; Burn 0
Prerequisite touchsight
Your strands of aether surround you, making it virtually impossible
for a violent motion to catch you off guard, so long as the motion
originates within their range. You are never denied your Dexterity
bonus to AC against attacks from within 30 feet because of being
flat-footed or because your assailant is unseen or invisible. You
always succeed at any Perception check to act on the surprise
round against opponents within 30 feet.
TRAIL OF FLAMES
Element fire; Type utility (Sp); Level 5; Burn 0
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance yes
When you take the withdraw or run action, you can leave a wall
of fire in all squares you exit that lasts for 1 round.
TREMORSENSE
Element earth; Type utility (Su); Level 3; Burn 0
You can take a move action to gain tremorsense 30 feet for 1 round
on any earth or stone surface that you touch. You can accept
1 point of burn to increase the duration to 1 round per kineticist
level you possess. While benefiting from this tremorsense, your
earth blasts and composite blasts that include earth components
don’t suffer a miss chance from concealment or total concealment
against creatures you detect with your tremorsense.
TREMORSENSE, GREATER
Element earth; Type utility (Su); Level 5; Burn 0
Prerequisite tremorsense
You can spend 10 minutes to extend your tremorsense outward
while in a natural underground setting, letting you learn three facts
as if using commune with nature, except your tremorsense can’t tell
if a creature is a woodland creature or a powerful unnatural creature.
VEIL OF MISTS
Element water; Type utility (Su); Level 2; Burn 0
You create a misty veil over your features, disguising yourself as disguise self for a number of minutes equal to your Constitution
modifier. If you accept 1 point of burn, until the next time your
burn is removed, each use of this wild talent lasts until you
dismiss it.

# 29
VOICE OF THE WIND
Element air; Type utility (Sp); Level 1; Burn 0
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance yes
When you whisper, you can have the wind carry your voice to the
ears of anyone you can see within 120 feet, as if they were one
of the targets of a message spell you cast. Alternatively, you can
send your voice to a distant location as if casting whispering wind.
WATER MANIPULATOR
Element water; Type utility (Sp); Level 3; Burn 0
Prerequisite kinetic cover
Saving Throw none; see text; Spell Resistance no
You can manipulate massive quantities of water. As a standard
action, you can raise or lower the level of water as if using control
water, or move an amount of water equal to 1/1,000th the
amount controlled by that spell to a different location in range.
The water remains where you placed it for as long as you remain
motionless and take a standard action each round to concentrate
on this effect. This wild talent causes a slow effect on creatures
made of water, just like control water (Will negates). When you
cease concentrating, the water flows normally unless you accept
1 point of burn to extend the duration and hold the water in its
current position for 10 minutes per kineticist level you possess.
WATERDANCER
Element water; Type utility (Sp); Level 3; Burn 0
You call forth a current of water to increase your speed and allow
you to swim with ease, as if under the effects of slipstreamAPG
with unlimited duration.
WATERDANCER, GREATER
Element water; Type utility (Su); Level 5; Burn 0
Prerequisite waterdancer
You can move across water (as water walk) at will and breathe
underwater, and your slashing and bludgeoning attacks don’t
take the usual penalties when you’re underwater.
WATERSENSE
Element water; Type utility (Su); Level 4; Burn —
You gain tremorsense with a range of 30 feet to detect anything
in contact with the same body of water as you. While you
are benefiting from this tremorsense, your water blasts and
composite blasts that include water don’t suffer a miss chance
from concealment or total concealment against creatures you
detect with this tremorsense.
WEATHER MASTER
Element air; Type utility (Sp); Level 8; Burn 0
By focusing on your connection to air and seeding the air around
you for 10 minutes, you can create powerful weather effects,
as control weather. You can create tornadoes or hurricane-force
winds, as appropriate for the season. If you have access to the
fire element, you can create hot weather, a heat wave, a thaw,
or an early spring. If you have access to the water element, you
can create all other types of weather listed in control weather.
WIND MANIPULATOR
Element air; Type utility (Sp); Level 6; Burn 0
Prerequisite engulfing winds
You can call forth mighty winds in an enormous area. As a
standard action, you can alter the wind around you as if using
control winds, but the change remains only for as long as you
continue to take a standard action to concentrate on this effect.
If you accept 1 point of burn, you can extend the duration to 10
minutes per kineticist level you possess without your needing
to concentrate.
WINDSIGHT
Element air; Type utility (Su); Level 3; Burn —
You can see through mist and fog (including fog cloud and similar
magic). In areas of moderate or stronger wind, you can see and
hear as if you were standing at both your own position and a
position a number of feet in the wind’s direction equal to the
wind’s speed in miles per hour, potentially allowing you to see
around corners and other obstacles.
WINDSIGHT, GREATER
Element air; Type utility (Su); Level 5; Burn 0
Prerequisite windsight
You can send a slight breeze in a path up to 480 feet long and then
back to where you wait. This allows you to use your windsight
wild talent to catch a quick glimpse and hear a tiny snippet from
any location that could be reached by the wind traveling that
distance (the wind’s path can’t pass through openings smaller
than 1 inch in diameter). The breeze travels 100 feet per round,
so what you see and hear is delayed by 1 round for every 50 feet
of the path. If you spend at least 10 minutes to set up a steady
flow of wind, you can concentrate for up to 1 minute per level
to gain continuous visual and auditory information for as long
as you concentrate, delayed by 1 round for every 100 feet the
wind travels (since the steady flow of wind has to travel only
one way). While there is no invisible sensor to detect with this
ability, creatures along the path of the breeze may notice a light
wind, though it may not seem out of the ordinary.
WINGS OF AIR
Element air; Type utility (Sp); Level 3; Burn 0
Prerequisite air cushion or air’s leap
The air bends to your will, allowing you to soar to great heights.
You are constantly under the effects of fly. If this effect is dispelled,
you can call it forth again as a standard action.
