Consummate Liar			KEY:Mesmerist ~ Consummate Liar			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DEFINE:ConsummateLiarBonus|0																						DESC:A mesmerist adds %1 as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn't have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.|ConsummateLiarBonus																																																																																								BONUS:VAR|ConsummateLiarBonus|max(MesmeristLVL/2,1)	BONUS:SKILL|Bluff|ConsummateLiarBonus																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.39
Hypnotic Stare			KEY:Mesmerist ~ Hypnotic Stare			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:HypnoticStarePenalty|0																						DESC:A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a -%1 penalty on Will saving throws. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target's mind; the creature doesn't remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist's focus than the target's perception of his stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists' stares don't stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches' evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.|HypnoticStarePenalty			BONUS:VAR|HypnoticStarePenalty|2	BONUS:VAR|HypnoticStarePenalty|1|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,8																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.39
Knacks				KEY:Mesmerist ~ Knacks					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																																DESC:Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells.

Mesmerist Tricks			KEY:Mesmerist ~ Mesmerist Tricks Output		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																														DESC:A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant %1 of these tricks. He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).&nl; To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick's description), even if it isn't his turn. The subject must be within medium range (%2 feet) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick's triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn't need line of sight to trigger it-but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.&nl; Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can't be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick's entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is %3.&nl; The mesmerist knows %4 trick(s). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows.

Bold Stare				KEY:Mesmerist ~ Bold Stare Output			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																														DESC:A mesmerist's hypnotic stare imposes further effects upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can't be changed later. The mesmerist can't choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted.

Touch Treatment			KEY:Mesmerist ~ Touch Treatment			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:TouchTreatmentsUses|0																					DESC:The mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions-especially those that affect their minds-by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment %1 times per day. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability from the following list: fascinated, shaken|TouchTreatmentsUses	DESC:, confused, dazed, frightened, sickened|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,6	DESC:, cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,10	DESC:.

Manifold Tricks			KEY:Mesmerist ~ Manifold Tricks			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:ManifoldTricksCount|0																						DESC:The mesmerist can have %1 tricks implanted at a time. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist's tricks).|ManifoldTricksCount																																																																																							BONUS:VAR|ManifoldTricksCount|2+(MesmeristLVL-5)/4																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.43
Mental Potency			KEY:Mesmerist ~ Mental Potency			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary				DEFINE:MentalPotencyBonus|0																						DESC:The mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment and illusion spell he casts increase by %1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by %1 (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be).|MentalPotencyBonus																																																																BONUS:VAR|MentalPotencyBonus|min(MesmeristLVL/5,4)																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.43
Glib Lie				KEY:Mesmerist ~ Glib Lie				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:GlibLieDC|0																							DESC:A mesmerist can deceive truth-detecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of %1 to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn't detect the mesmerist's lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell's bonus on Bluff checks.|GlibLieDC																																																																																	BONUS:VAR|GlibLieDC|15+MesmeristLVL																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.43
Masterful Tricks			KEY:Mesmerist ~ Masterful Tricks			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																														DESC:A mesmerist can choose masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.43
Rule Minds				KEY:Mesmerist ~ Rule Minds				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																														DESC:A mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force the creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell's DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn't a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can't be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.

###Block: Mesmerist Tricks
#Ability			Unique key							Category				Type						Description																																																																																																																																																																																																																															Source page
Astounding Avoidance	KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Astounding Avoidance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:The subject can avoid damage from magical and unusual attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a saving throw against an attack or spell that normally deals half damage on a successful save, before the subject rolls the save. If the subject succeeds at her save, she takes no damage. 	DESC:The subject takes only half damage is she fails her save. |PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,12	DESC:The benefits of this trick don't stack with those of the evasion or stalwart class features.																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Compel Alacrity		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Compel Alacrity		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A dash of mental speed lets the subject push past her physical limits to avoid an enemy. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject begins her turn within an enemy's reach. The subject can move %1 feet as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. The subject can't move farther than her speed in this way. The movement from this trick doesn't count against the subject's movement speed for that round.|10+5*floor(MesmeristLVL/5)																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.40
False Flanker		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ False Flanker			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A duplicate of the mesmerist appears momentarily, as though he were fighting in tandem with the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject moves into or begins her turn in a square where she threatens an enemy. An illusory duplicate of the mesmerist appears in any unoccupied space adjacent to that enemy. This duplicate counts as threatening the enemy for the purposes of determining flanking, but can't actually make attacks. The duplicate disappears at the end of the turn during which the trick is triggered. This is an illusion (figment) effect, and a creature that interacts with the false flanker can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect.																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Fearsome Guise		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Fearsome Guise		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A veil of illusion makes the subject appear to be someone else and then transform into a hideous monster at an opportune time. While this trick is implanted, the subject's appearance is altered, as disguise self. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attacks a creature. The illusory appearance briefly makes the subject appear monstrous, then ends. The mesmerist attempts an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of the triggering attack. The restrictions on attempts to demoralize a target (the target being within 30 feet and able to see and hear the creature attempting the Intimidate check) apply to the subject of the trick. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Gift of Will		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Gift of Will			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A small portion of the mesmerist's vast mental power buttresses his ally's mind. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a Will saving throw or a Sense Motive check, or is targeted by an Intimidate check to demoralize her. For a saving throw, the subject uses the mesmerist's Will saving throw bonus instead of her own. For a Sense Motive check or Intimidate check, she adds the mesmerist's Charisma bonus as a morale bonus on the check or to the DC. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Levitation Buffer		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Levitation Buffer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A mesmerist's telekinetic assault renders foes around the subject less of a threat. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when either an enemy moves adjacent to the subject or the subject begins her turn with one or more enemies adjacent to her. The mesmerist can either lift all enemies adjacent to the subject slightly into the air or push them all away from the subject. Lifting enemies causes them to move at half speed and take a -4 penalty to their CMDs against bull rush, drag, and reposition attempts for 1 round (Will negates). The speed reduction and CMD penalty don't stack with those from hostile levitation. Pushing enemies away requires the mesmerist to attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check using %1 as his CMB. Any enemy that's successfully pushed moves away from the subject of the trick using the normal rules for a bull rush.|MesmeristLVL+CHA																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Linked Reaction		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Linked Reaction		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A hive mind allows the mesmerist and an ally to share one another's reaction times. The mesmerist can trigger this trick whe either the subject or the mesmerist is surprise and the other isn't (even if the mesmerist would normally be unable to take actions because of being surprised). Both the mesmerist and the subject can act in this surprise round. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself. 																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Mask Misery			KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Mask Misery			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:The subject can shrug off a condition for a short time before succumbing to it. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject becomes affected by a minor 	DESC:or moderate|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,6	DESC: condition listed under the touch treatment ability. The subject can ignore the effect of 	DESC:that|PREVARLT:MesmeristLVL,6	DESC:a moderate|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,6	DESC: condition for 1d4 rounds, after which the subject takes the full effect. This has no effect on any conditions affecting the subject other than the triggering condition, even if those other effects are also listed under touch treatment. The rounds during which the subject ignores the triggering effect still count against that effect's duration; if the duration of mask misery is longer than the effect lasts, the subject isn't affected by the condition at all. If an effect that imposes more than one condition triggers this trick, the subject ignores all eligible conditions. 	DESC:This trick ends minor conditions entirely instead of suppressing them temporarily. |PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,6	DESC:The mesmerist doesn't need to have touch treatment to choose or use this trick.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Meek Facade			KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Meek Facade			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:The subject magically seems like a weak target, goading an enemy into attacking her. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject misses a creature with an attack (even if it's part of a full attack in which she hits that creature with another attack). The enemy must attack no one other than the subject, and the subject gains a +%1 dodge bonus to AC against the triggering enemy's attacks. Both of these effects last for 1 round. This is mind-affecting compulsion effect.|2+MesmeristLVL/5																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Mesmeric Mirror		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Mesmeric Mirror		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:An illusory image appears near the subject to throw off attackers. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked or becomes the target of a spell that requires an attack roll. %1 duplicate(s) of the subject appears, and the attacker must determine randomly which it hits (as mirror image). Each image lasts for %2 minute(s) or until destroyed. This is an illusion (figment) effect.|min(1+MesmeristLVL/5,5)|MesmeristLVL																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Mesmeric Pantomine	KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Mesmeric Pantomine		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:By orchestrating the movement of his ally's body, the mesmerist imparts to that ally his own skill at a physical task. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check. The subject either uses the mesmerist's bonus on the skill check in place of her own or gains a +%1 morale bonus on the check, whichever results in a higher modifier. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.|CHA																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Misdirection		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Misdirection			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:An enemy's perception of an attack by the subject shifts, making the foe unprepared to defend against the attack. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject makes an attack or uses a spell that requires an attack roll. The mesmerist attempts a Bluff check to feint against a single target of the subject's attack. Unlike a normal feint, this ability can be used on non-melee attacks. If the feint succeeds, the target of the attack is denied its Dex bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The target doesn't suffer any additional effects that the mesmerist or the subject would cause on a normal feint or Bluff check. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Psychosomatic Surge	KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Psychosomatic Surge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:Psychic magic soothes the subject, alleviating her wounds temporarily. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage. The subject gains 1d8	DESC:+%1|MesmeristLVL/2|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,2	DESC: temporary hit points. If the damage from the triggering attack would have reduced the subject to 0 hit points or fewer, this trick grants an additional 1d8 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour or until discharged.																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Reflection of Weakness	KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Reflection of Weakness	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:Psychic feedback causes an enemy to suffer from the same weakening effect it imposes on the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when an attack or spell used by an enemy causes the subject to take ability damage, ability drain, bleed damage, or a minor or moderate condition listed under the touch treatment class feature. If the trick is triggered by ability damage, ability drain, or bleed damage, the amount of damage or drain the subject takes is reduced by 2 points (to a minimum of 0 points), and the creature that made the attack or cast the spell takes 2 points of ability damage to an ability score of the mesmerist's choice. The monster can attempt a Will save to negate the ability damage. This ability can be used if the attacker inflicts a curse, disease, or poison that deals ability damage or drain, but only if it deals that damage immediately, with no onset time. If the trick is triggered by the subject gaining a condition, the subject is still affected by the condition, but the attacker takes a condition of the mesmerist's choice for 1 round. This condition must come from the minor condition or moderate condition lists of the touch treatment class feature. The enemy can attempt a Will save to avoid gaining the condition. The mesmerist doesn't need to have touch treatment to select or use this trick.	SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Shadow Splinter		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Shadow Splinter		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:The mesmerist protects the subject against an attack and redirects the harm to someone else. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage from an attack. The damage the subject takes is reduced by %1 (to a maximum of the total amount of damage the attack deals). Another creature within range of the original attack, other than the attacker, is affected by a shadow illusion that makes it appear as if the attacker is attacking that creature instead of the attacker's actual target. This second creature takes an amount of damage equal to the amount by which the attack's damage was reduced. This shadow doesn't require a roll to hit and ignores cover and concealment, but the target can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. If it succeeds at this save, it neither takes the damage nor believes the attacker targeted it. This trick can't be triggered if there's no eligible second creature within range to take the redirected damage. This is an illusion (shadow) effect.|3+CHA																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.42
Spectral Smoke		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Spectral Smoke		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A cloud of smoke pops up around the subject, foiling attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked by an attack or by a spell that requires an attack roll. A smoke cloud appears in the subject's square and in a %1-foot radius around it. This cloud lasts for %2 round(s). The cloud functions as fog cloud, but is an illusion (figment) effect that can't be dispersed by wind and can be used underwater. A creature that interacts with the cloud can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect.|min(10+5*floor(MesmeristLVL/5),30)|MesmeristLVL																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.42
Vanish Arrow		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Vanish Arrow			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:With a flourish, the mesmerist snatches a projectile from an enemy before it can be shot. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by a ranged weapon attack, before the attack roll is made. The mesmerist attempts a Sleight of Hand check opposed by the attacker's Perception check. If the mesmerist succeeds, that ranged attack automatically misses, and the projectile appears stowed on the mesmerist's person. If the attacker is making a full attack, this affects only one of the attacks (of the mesmerist's choice). If the attack is made with a javelin or other thrown weapon, the attacker gains a +4 bonus on its Perception check. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects are not affected by this ability.
