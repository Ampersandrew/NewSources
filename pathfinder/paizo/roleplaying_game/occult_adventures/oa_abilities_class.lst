Consummate Liar			KEY:Mesmerist ~ Consummate Liar			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DEFINE:ConsummateLiarBonus|0																						DESC:A mesmerist adds %1 as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn't have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13.

Hypnotic Stare			KEY:Mesmerist ~ Hypnotic Stare			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:HypnoticStarePenalty|0																						DESC:A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a -%1 penalty on Will saving throws. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target's mind; the creature doesn't remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist's focus than the target's perception of his stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists' stares don't stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches' evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.|HypnoticStarePenalty			BONUS:VAR|HypnoticStarePenalty|2	BONUS:VAR|HypnoticStarePenalty|1|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,8																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.39

Each day, he can implant %1 of these tricks. He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).&nl; To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick's description), even if it isn't his turn. The subject must be within medium range (%2 feet) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick's triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn't need line of sight to trigger it-but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.&nl; Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can't be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick's entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is %3.&nl; The mesmerist knows %4 trick(s). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows.

The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can't be changed later.

He can use touch treatment %1 times per day. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target.

Manifold Tricks			KEY:Mesmerist ~ Manifold Tricks			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:ManifoldTricksCount|0																						DESC:The mesmerist can have %1 tricks implanted at a time. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist's tricks).|ManifoldTricksCount																																																																																							BONUS:VAR|ManifoldTricksCount|2+(MesmeristLVL-5)/4																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.43
Mental Potency			KEY:Mesmerist ~ Mental Potency			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary				DEFINE:MentalPotencyBonus|0																						DESC:The mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment and illusion spell he casts increase by %1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by %1 (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be).|MentalPotencyBonus																																																																BONUS:VAR|MentalPotencyBonus|min(MesmeristLVL/5,4)																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.43
Glib Lie				KEY:Mesmerist ~ Glib Lie				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:GlibLieDC|0																							DESC:A mesmerist can deceive truth-detecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of %1 to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn't detect the mesmerist's lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell's bonus on Bluff checks.|GlibLieDC																																																																																	BONUS:VAR|GlibLieDC|15+MesmeristLVL																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.43
Masterful Tricks			KEY:Mesmerist ~ Masterful Tricks			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																														DESC:A mesmerist can choose masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.43
Rule Minds				KEY:Mesmerist ~ Rule Minds				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																														DESC:A mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force the creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell's DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn't a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can't be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.
