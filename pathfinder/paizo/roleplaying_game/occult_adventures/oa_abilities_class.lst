###Block: Kineticist
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Kineticist ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:Kineticists are proficient with all simple weapons and light armor, but not shields.	ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=ArmorProfLight|TYPE=WeaponProfSimple
Elemental Focus			KEY:Kineticist ~ Elemental Focus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:At 1st level, a kineticist chooses one primary element on which to focus. This element determines how she accesses the raw power of the Ethereal Plane, and grants her access to specific wild talents (see below) and additional class skills. She can select aether (telekinesis), air (aerokinesis), earth (geokinesis), fire (pyrokinesis), or water (hydrokinesis). She gains her selected element's basic utility wild talent (basic telekinesis, basic aerokinesis, basic geokinesis, basic pyrokinesis, or basic hydrokinesis; see page 23) as a bonus wild talent. See Elements on page 14 for the specific abilities granted by each element.
Wild Talents			KEY:Kineticist ~ Wild Talents				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:A kineticist can use wild talents—magical abilities similar to spells but drawn from the kineticist's innate psychic talent and usable at will. Wild talents are typically spell-like abilities (though some are supernatural abilities), and take a standard action to use unless otherwise noted. A wild talent always has the elemental descriptor or descriptors (aether, air, earth, fire, or water) matching its Element entry. A wild talent that can be used with any of several elements gains the appropriate elemental descriptor when used with an element. For example, the wall wild talent gains the earth descriptor when used by a geokineticist. Every wild talent has an effective spell level. A kineticist can always select 1st-level wild talents, but she can select a wild talent of a higher level only if her kineticist level is at least double the wild talent's effective spell level. Kinetic blast and defense wild talents are always considered to have an effective spell level equal to 1/2 the kineticist's class level (to a maximum effective spell level of 9th at kineticist level 18th). Unless otherwise noted, the DC for a saving throw against a wild talent is equal to 10 + the wild talent's effective spell level + the kineticist's Constitution modifier. The kineticist uses her Constitution modifier on all concentration checks for wild talents. In addition to the wild talents she gains from her other class features, at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a kineticist selects a new utility wild talent from the list of options available to her. A kineticist can select only universal wild talents or those that match her element (see Elemental Focus above). At 6th, 10th, and 16th levels, a kineticist can replace one of her utility wild talents with another wild talent of the same level or lower. She can't replace a wild talent that she used to qualify for another of her wild talents.
Burn					KEY:Kineticist ~ Burn					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:At 1st level, a kineticist can overexert herself to channel more power than normal, pushing past the limit of what is safe for her body by accepting burn. Some of her wild talents allow her to accept burn in exchange for a greater effect, while others require her to accept a certain amount of burn to use that talent at all. For each point of burn she accepts, a kineticist takes 1 point of nonlethal damage per character level. This damage can't be healed by any means other than getting a full night's rest, which removes all burn and associated nonlethal damage. Nonlethal damage from burn can't be reduced or redirected, and a kineticist incapable of taking nonlethal damage can't accept burn. A kineticist can accept only 1 point of burn per round. This limit rises to 2 points of burn at 6th level, and rises by 1 additional point every 3 levels thereafter. A kineticist can't choose to accept burn if it would put her total number of points of burn higher than 3 + her Constitution modifier (though she can be forced to accept more burn from a source outside her control). A kineticist who has accepted burn never benefits from abilities that allow her to ignore or alter the effects she receives from nonlethal damage.
Kinetic Blast			KEY:Kineticist ~ Kinetic Blast			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:At 1st level, a kineticist gains a kinetic blast wild talent of her choice. This kinetic blast must be a simple blast that matches her element. As a standard action, the kineticist can unleash a kinetic blast at a single target up to a range of 30 feet. She must have at least one hand free to aim the blast (or one prehensile appendage, if she doesn't have hands). All damage from a kinetic blast is treated as magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. Kinetic blasts count as a type of weapon for the purpose of feats such as Weapon Focus. The kineticist is never considered to be wielding or gripping the kinetic blast (regardless of effects from form infusions; see Infusion on page 12), and she can't use Vital Strike feats with kinetic blasts. Even the weakest kinetic blast involves a sizable mass of elemental matter or energy, so kinetic blasts always deal full damage to swarms of any size (though only area blasts deal extra damage to swarms). A readied kinetic blast can be used to counterspell any spell of equal or lower level that shares its descriptor. A kinetic blast that deals energy damage of any type (including force) has the corresponding descriptor. The various kinetic blasts, as well as additional rules for simple blasts, are described on pages 15-16.
Gather Power			KEY:Kineticist ~ Gather Power				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:If she has both hands free (or all of her prehensile appendages free, for unusual kineticists), a kineticist can gather energy or elemental matter as a move action. Gathering power creates an extremely loud, visible display in a 20-foot radius centered on the kineticist, as the energy or matter swirls around her. Gathering power in this way allows the kineticist to reduce the total burn cost of a blast wild talent she uses in the same round by 1 point. The kineticist can instead gather power for 1 full round in order to reduce the total burn cost of a blast wild talent used on her next turn by 2 points (to a minimum of 0 points). If she does so, she can also gather power as a move action during her next turn to reduce the burn cost by a total of 3 points. If the kineticist takes damage during or after gathering power and before using the kinetic blast that releases it, she must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 10 + damage taken + effective spell level of her kinetic blast) or lose the energy in a wild surge that forces her to accept a number of points of burn equal to the number of points by which her gathered power would have reduced the burn cost. This ability can never reduce the burn cost of a wild talent below 0 points.
Infusion				KEY:Kineticist ~ Infusion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:At 1st level, a kineticist gains an infusion wild talent from the list of options available based on her elemental focus. She gains additional infusions at 3rd, 5th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 17th, and 19th levels. By using infusions along with her kinetic blasts, a kineticist can alter her kinetic blasts to suit her needs. Infusions come in two types, each of which changes a kinetic blast differently: a substance infusion causes an additional effect, while a form infusion causes the kinetic blast to manifest in a different way. Each infusion can alter only certain kinds of kinetic blasts, which are listed in its Associated Blasts entry. Each time the kineticist uses one of her kinetic blast wild talents, she can apply up to one associated form infusion and up to one associated substance infusion. Some infusions change the action required to activate a kinetic blast or entirely transform the kinetic blast's normal effects. The burn cost listed in each infusion's Burn entry is added to the burn cost of the kinetic blast the infusion modifies. The DC for a save against an infusion is based on the associated kinetic blast's effective spell level, not the level of the infusion. The DCs for form infusions are calculated using the kineticist's Dexterity modifier instead of her Constitution modifier. When a kineticist modifies a kinetic blast with a form infusion and a substance infusion that both require saving throws, each target first attempts a saving throw against the form infusion. If a target succeeds and a successful save negates the infusion's effects, the entire kinetic blast is negated; otherwise, the target then attempts a saving throw against the substance infusion. If a kineticist's form and substance infusions both alter the kinetic blast's damage, apply the substance infusion's alteration first. At 5th, 11th, and 17th levels, a kineticist can replace one of her infusions with another infusion of the same effective spell level or lower. She can't replace an infusion that she used to qualify for another of her wild talents. The descriptions of infusions begin on page 17.
Elemental Defense			KEY:Kineticist ~ Elemental Defense			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:At 2nd level, a kineticist gains her element's defense wild talent ( the descriptions of defense wild talents begin on page 16).
Elemental Overflow		KEY:Kineticist ~ Elemental Overflow			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:At 3rd level, a kineticist's body surges with energy from her chosen element whenever she accepts burn, causing her to glow with a nimbus of fire, weep water from her pores, or experience some other thematic effect. In addition, she receives a bonus on her attack rolls with kinetic blasts equal to the total number of points of burn she currently has, to a maximum bonus of +1 for every 3 kineticist levels she possesses. She also receives a bonus on damage rolls with her kinetic blast equal to double the bonus on attack rolls. The kineticist can suppress the visual effects of elemental overf low by concentrating for 1 full round, but doing so suppresses all of this ability's other benefits, as well. The next time the kineticist uses any wild talent, the visual effects and benefits return instantly. As a kineticist's body becomes more and more suffused with her element, she begins to gain more powerful benefits. Starting at 6th level, whenever she has at least 3 points of burn, the kineticist gains a +2 size bonus to two physical ability scores of her choice. She also gains a chance to ignore the effects of a critical hit or sneak attack equal to 5% x her current number of points of burn. At 11th level, whenever the kineticist has at least 5 points of burn, these bonuses increase to a +4 size bonus to one physical ability score of her choice and a +2 size bonus to each of her other two physical ability scores. At 16th level, whenever the kineticist has at least 7 points of burn, these bonuses increase to a +6 size bonus to one physical ability score of her choice, a +4 size bonus to a second physical ability score of her choice, and a +2 size bonus to the remaining physical ability score.
Infusion Specialization		KEY:Kineticist ~ Infusion Specialization		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:At 5th level, whenever a kineticist uses one or more infusions with a blast, she reduces the combined burn cost of the infusions by 1. This can't reduce the total cost of the infusions used below 0. She reduces the burn cost by 1 additional point at 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 20th levels.
Metakinesis				KEY:Kineticist ~ Metakinesis				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:At 5th level, a kineticist gains the ability to alter her kinetic blasts as if with metamagic feats by accepting burn. By accepting 1 point of burn, she can empower her kinetic blast (as if using Empower Spell). At 9th level, by accepting 2 points of burn, she can maximize her kinetic blast as if using Maximize Spell. At 13th level, by accepting 3 points of burn, she can quicken her kinetic blast as if using Quicken Spell. At 17th level, by accepting 4 points of burn, the kineticist can use her kinetic blast twice with the same standard action, or swift action if she also uses metakinesis to quicken the blast. When she uses a double kinetic blast, all modifications, such as metakinesis and infusions, apply to both of the blasts, but the kineticist needs to pay the burn cost only once.
Internal Buffer			KEY:Kineticist ~ Internal Buffer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:At 6th level, a kineticist's study of her body and the elemental forces that course through it allow her to form an internal buffer to store extra energy. The buffer starts empty and doesn't replenish each day, but the kineticist can accept 1 point of burn to add 1 point to the buffer as a full-round action, to a maximum of 1 point total. This maximum increases to 2 points at 11th level and to 3 points at 16th level. Once the kineticist adds points to her buffer, they remain indefinitely until she spends them. When she would otherwise accept burn, a kineticist can spend 1 point from her buffer to avoid accepting 1 point of burn. She cannot spend more than 1 point from her buffer in this way for a single wild talent. Points spent from the internal buffer don't activate elemental overf low or add to its effects. Similarly, this buffer can be used to exceed the limit on the number of points of burn the kineticist can accept in a single turn.
Expanded Element			KEY:Kineticist ~ Expanded Element			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:At 7th level, a kineticist learns to use another element or expands her understanding of her own element. She can choose any element, including her primary element. She gains one of that element's simple blast wild talents that she does not already possess, if any. She also gains all composite blast wild talents whose prerequisites she meets, as well as the basic wild talent of her chosen expanded element (for instance, basic aerokinesis if she chooses air). See Composite Blasts on page 15 for additional rules for and descriptions of composite blasts. She doesn't gain the defense wild talent of the expanded element. If the kineticist's expanded element is different from her primary element, she treats her kineticist level as 4 levels lower for the purpose of determining which wild talents she can learn from her expanded element. If the kineticist chooses to expand her understanding of an element she already has, she gains an additional utility wild talent or infusion of her choice from that element, as if from her infusion or wild talent class feature, as appropriate. At 15th level, the kineticist can either select a new element or expand her understanding of her original element. She can't select the same element she selected at 7th level unless it is her primary element. She gains all the benefits from her new expanded element as listed above. However, if the kineticist selected her primary element as her expanded element at both 7th and 15th levels, her mastery of that element increases. For wild talents of her element, the kineticist gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, as well as to caster level and DCs.
Supercharge				KEY:Kineticist ~ Supercharge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	DESC:At 11th level, when using gather power as a move action, a kineticist can reduce the total burn cost of a single wild talent by 2 points instead of 1. When using gather power for 1 full round, she can reduce the burn cost of a single wild talent by 3 points instead of 2.
Composite Specialization	KEY:Kineticist ~ Composite Specialization		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	DESC:At 16th level, a kineticist becomes more adept at creating composite blasts. She reduces the burn cost of all composite blasts by 1 point. This can't reduce the cost of a composite blast below 0 points.
Metakinetic Master		KEY:Kineticist ~ Metakinetic Master			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	DESC:At 19th level, a kineticist chooses one type of metakinesis, such as empower or quicken. She reduces the burn cost of that metakinesis by 1 point (to a minimum of 0 points).
Omnikinesis				KEY:Kineticist ~ Omnikinesis				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Kineticist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	DESC:At 20th level, a kineticist transcends the distinction between the different elements and can bend all creation to her will. By accepting 1 point of burn (in addition to any burn requirement of the kinetic blast she chooses), she can use any blast wild talent she doesn't know. By accepting 1 point of burn as a standard action, she can change any of her wild talents into any other wild talent of the same category (such as simple blasts or defense) for 24 hours, ignoring any elemental requirements or restrictions (but not any other requirements or restrictions).

SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Spirit				KEY:Medium ~ Spirit				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																													DESC:A medium serves as a vessel to channel spirits—astral echoes of powerful souls from ages past that live on in myth and legend. Each day, a medium can channel a spirit through a ritual known as a seance. Seances take 1 hour to perform and require the medium's concentration. At the end of a seance, the medium invites a local spirit to inhabit him and serve as his spirit for that day. Each spirit arises from one of six legends. Though the medium can choose the legend to which the spirit he channels belongs, he must channel that spirit from an appropriate location. Each spirit has a favored location it usually inhabits, though spirits may also be present at other locations appropriate to their legends. The medium gains the spirit's listed seance boon and lesser spirit power for 24 hours. 	DESC:The medium also gains the spirit's intermediate spirit power|PREVARGTEQ:MediumLVL,6	DESC:, its greater spirit power|PREVARGTEQ:MediumLVL,11	DESC:, and its supreme spirit power|PREVARGTEQ:MediumLVL,17	DESC:. After 24 hours, the medium loses contact with the channeled spirit and can perform another seance.&nl; A medium can invite his allies to participate in his seance—shared seance and certain spirit powers affect other participants. A character counts as participating so long as she maintains physical contact with another participating character and willfully opens herself to the spirit; unlike the medium, other participating characters can take other actions during this time. Only creatures with an Intelligence score of at least 3 can participate in a seance.&nl; In addition to granting power to the medium, a channeled spirit can influence the medium. By channeling a spirit, the medium allows the spirit to gain 1 point of influence over him. If the medium loses that 1 point of influence, he loses contact with the spirit, though he is still unable to perform a new seance until the normal 24 hour period has elapsed since his last seance. When the spirit leaves after the 24-hour duration and before the next seance, the spirit's influence over the medium resets to 0. Certain abilities allow the medium to gain additional power in exchange for allowing the spirit more influence over him.&nl; When a spirit gains at least 3 points of influence over the medium, the dual impulses housed within the same body cause the medium to meld with his spirit's consciousness. The resulting muddled sense of self and struggle for control causes the medium to take a –2 penalty on initiative checks as well as a specific additional penalty. However, the spirit's mental presence grants the medium a +4 bonus against possession effects and a +2 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects that are not related to possession.&nl; If a spirit ever attains 5 or more points of influence over the medium, the medium completely loses control to the spirit. He effectively becomes an NPC under the GM's control until after he awakens the next day with the spirit gone.&nl; During his seance, the medium can choose to channel a weaker spirit to gain its help without incurring as much of its influence. If he does so, he can forgo any number of spirit powers, starting with his most powerful spirit power. For each spirit power he forgoes, the medium can use his spirit surge ability twice without incurring influence.	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Medium Spirit Choice|1	SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Spirit Surge			KEY:Medium ~ Spirit Surge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:SpiritSurgeDice|0																					DESC:After failing a d20 roll that was modified by his spirit bonus, a medium can allow his spirit to gain 1 additional point of influence over him in order to add 1d%1 to the check's result without taking an action. This can cause the check to succeed instead of fail. The medium must be conscious and aware to use this ability, and he can use this ability at most once per round.|SpiritSurgeDice																																																																																							BONUS:VAR|SpiritSurgeDice|6+2*floor(MediumLVL/10)																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Shared Seance			KEY:Medium ~ Shared Seance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																													DESC:A medium can share his channeled spirit's aid with his allies.

SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Taboo					KEY:Medium ~ Taboo				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																													DESC:During his daily seance, a medium can accept a taboo in order to appease his spirit. Each spirit lists example taboos, and the GM may allow additional taboos as well. Accepting a taboo allows the medium to use his spirit surge ability twice without incurring influence. The medium can select only a single taboo. The medium is not magically prevented from breaking his taboo, but if he breaks the taboo for any reason, he takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws for 1 hour and his spirit gains 1 point of influence over him. If the medium continues violating the taboo while taking the penalty, the duration of the penalty extends, but the spirit doesn't gain additional influence over the medium. If a spirit attains 5 points of influence because of a violated taboo, instead of possessing the medium, the spirit leaves the medium's body entirely, and the medium loses access to his spirit powers, spirit bonus, and spirit surge abilities until the next time he can perform a seance. Banishing a spirit in this way damages the medium's connection to that spirit's legend; the medium cannot channel spirits of that legend for 1 week, and the next time the medium channels a spirit of that legend, it starts with 2 points of influence over him instead of 1.				SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Haunt Channeler			KEY:Medium ~ Haunt Channeler			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MediumClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:HauntChannelDice|0	DEFINE:HauntChannelDC|0																	DESC:A medium can use his familiarity with spirits to assist him when dealing with haunts. He can always act on the surprise round against a haunt, and his touch funnels a portion of the haunt into himself, dealing %1d6 points of damage to the haunt as if via positive energy and allowing the medium to ask the haunt a single question. The haunt can answer the question however it chooses. Additionally, the medium can forgo his saving throw against a haunt's effects to funnel the haunt entirely into himself. If he does so, the medium suffers the haunt's full effect, but the haunt doesn't affect anyone else (even if it normally would). The haunt then gains control of the medium's body for 24 hours. Once per minute, the medium can attempt to end this possession early by succeeding at a Will save (DC %2).|HauntChannelDice|HauntChannelDC													BONUS:VAR|HauntChannelDice|MediumLVL/2	BONUS:VAR|HauntChannelDC|20+MediumLVL/2																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.31

The effects are similar to the spell call spirit, except that the duration is %1 round(s) and the spirit possesses the medium's body instead of appearing in a wispy form. The other participants of the seance must ask the questions. Once the medium attempts to call a spirit, he cannot attempt to call the same spirit again for 24 hours. Once per round, the medium can attempt to end the seance early by succeeding at a Will save (DC %2).|LocationChannelDuration|LocationChannelDC																																				BONUS:VAR|LocationChannelDuration|MediumLVL	BONUS:VAR|LocationChannelDC|20+MediumLVL/2																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.32	SPELLS:Medium|TIMES=ATWILL|CASTERLEVEL=MediumLVL|Call Spirit,13+CHA

A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target's mind; the creature doesn't remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist's focus than the target's perception of his stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists' stares don't stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches' evil eye hexes.

A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick's description), even if it isn't his turn. The subject must be within medium range (%2 feet) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick.

The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn't a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can't be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time.

#Ability			Unique key							Category				Type						Description																																																																																																																																																																																																																															Source page
Astounding Avoidance	KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Astounding Avoidance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:The subject can avoid damage from magical and unusual attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a saving throw against an attack or spell that normally deals half damage on a successful save, before the subject rolls the save. If the subject succeeds at her save, she takes no damage. 	DESC:The subject takes only half damage is she fails her save. |PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,12	DESC:The benefits of this trick don't stack with those of the evasion or stalwart class features.																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Compel Alacrity		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Compel Alacrity		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A dash of mental speed lets the subject push past her physical limits to avoid an enemy. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject begins her turn within an enemy's reach. The subject can move %1 feet as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. The subject can't move farther than her speed in this way. The movement from this trick doesn't count against the subject's movement speed for that round.|10+5*floor(MesmeristLVL/5)																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.40
False Flanker		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ False Flanker			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A duplicate of the mesmerist appears momentarily, as though he were fighting in tandem with the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject moves into or begins her turn in a square where she threatens an enemy. An illusory duplicate of the mesmerist appears in any unoccupied space adjacent to that enemy. This duplicate counts as threatening the enemy for the purposes of determining flanking, but can't actually make attacks. The duplicate disappears at the end of the turn during which the trick is triggered. This is an illusion (figment) effect, and a creature that interacts with the false flanker can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect.																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Fearsome Guise		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Fearsome Guise		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A veil of illusion makes the subject appear to be someone else and then transform into a hideous monster at an opportune time. While this trick is implanted, the subject's appearance is altered, as disguise self. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attacks a creature. The illusory appearance briefly makes the subject appear monstrous, then ends. The mesmerist attempts an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of the triggering attack. The restrictions on attempts to demoralize a target (the target being within 30 feet and able to see and hear the creature attempting the Intimidate check) apply to the subject of the trick. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Gift of Will		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Gift of Will			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A small portion of the mesmerist's vast mental power buttresses his ally's mind. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a Will saving throw or a Sense Motive check, or is targeted by an Intimidate check to demoralize her. For a saving throw, the subject uses the mesmerist's Will saving throw bonus instead of her own. For a Sense Motive check or Intimidate check, she adds the mesmerist's Charisma bonus as a morale bonus on the check or to the DC. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Levitation Buffer		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Levitation Buffer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A mesmerist's telekinetic assault renders foes around the subject less of a threat. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when either an enemy moves adjacent to the subject or the subject begins her turn with one or more enemies adjacent to her. The mesmerist can either lift all enemies adjacent to the subject slightly into the air or push them all away from the subject. Lifting enemies causes them to move at half speed and take a -4 penalty to their CMDs against bull rush, drag, and reposition attempts for 1 round (Will negates). The speed reduction and CMD penalty don't stack with those from hostile levitation. Pushing enemies away requires the mesmerist to attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check using %1 as his CMB. Any enemy that's successfully pushed moves away from the subject of the trick using the normal rules for a bull rush.|MesmeristLVL+CHA																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Linked Reaction		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Linked Reaction		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A hive mind allows the mesmerist and an ally to share one another's reaction times. The mesmerist can trigger this trick whe either the subject or the mesmerist is surprise and the other isn't (even if the mesmerist would normally be unable to take actions because of being surprised). Both the mesmerist and the subject can act in this surprise round. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself. 																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Mask Misery			KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Mask Misery			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:The subject can shrug off a condition for a short time before succumbing to it. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject becomes affected by a minor 	DESC:or moderate|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,6	DESC: condition listed under the touch treatment ability. The subject can ignore the effect of 	DESC:that|PREVARLT:MesmeristLVL,6	DESC:a moderate|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,6	DESC: condition for 1d4 rounds, after which the subject takes the full effect. This has no effect on any conditions affecting the subject other than the triggering condition, even if those other effects are also listed under touch treatment. The rounds during which the subject ignores the triggering effect still count against that effect's duration; if the duration of mask misery is longer than the effect lasts, the subject isn't affected by the condition at all. If an effect that imposes more than one condition triggers this trick, the subject ignores all eligible conditions. 	DESC:This trick ends minor conditions entirely instead of suppressing them temporarily. |PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,6	DESC:The mesmerist doesn't need to have touch treatment to choose or use this trick.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Meek Facade			KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Meek Facade			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:The subject magically seems like a weak target, goading an enemy into attacking her. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject misses a creature with an attack (even if it's part of a full attack in which she hits that creature with another attack). The enemy must attack no one other than the subject, and the subject gains a +%1 dodge bonus to AC against the triggering enemy's attacks. Both of these effects last for 1 round. This is mind-affecting compulsion effect.|2+MesmeristLVL/5																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Mesmeric Mirror		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Mesmeric Mirror		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:An illusory image appears near the subject to throw off attackers. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked or becomes the target of a spell that requires an attack roll. %1 duplicate(s) of the subject appears, and the attacker must determine randomly which it hits (as mirror image). Each image lasts for %2 minute(s) or until destroyed. This is an illusion (figment) effect.|min(1+MesmeristLVL/5,5)|MesmeristLVL																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Mesmeric Pantomine	KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Mesmeric Pantomine		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:By orchestrating the movement of his ally's body, the mesmerist imparts to that ally his own skill at a physical task. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check. The subject either uses the mesmerist's bonus on the skill check in place of her own or gains a +%1 morale bonus on the check, whichever results in a higher modifier. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.|CHA																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Misdirection		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Misdirection			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:An enemy's perception of an attack by the subject shifts, making the foe unprepared to defend against the attack. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject makes an attack or uses a spell that requires an attack roll. The mesmerist attempts a Bluff check to feint against a single target of the subject's attack. Unlike a normal feint, this ability can be used on non-melee attacks. If the feint succeeds, the target of the attack is denied its Dex bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The target doesn't suffer any additional effects that the mesmerist or the subject would cause on a normal feint or Bluff check. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Psychosomatic Surge	KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Psychosomatic Surge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:Psychic magic soothes the subject, alleviating her wounds temporarily. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage. The subject gains 1d8	DESC:+%1|MesmeristLVL/2|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,2	DESC: temporary hit points. If the damage from the triggering attack would have reduced the subject to 0 hit points or fewer, this trick grants an additional 1d8 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour or until discharged.																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Reflection of Weakness	KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Reflection of Weakness	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:Psychic feedback causes an enemy to suffer from the same weakening effect it imposes on the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when an attack or spell used by an enemy causes the subject to take ability damage, ability drain, bleed damage, or a minor or moderate condition listed under the touch treatment class feature. If the trick is triggered by ability damage, ability drain, or bleed damage, the amount of damage or drain the subject takes is reduced by 2 points (to a minimum of 0 points), and the creature that made the attack or cast the spell takes 2 points of ability damage to an ability score of the mesmerist's choice. The monster can attempt a Will save to negate the ability damage. This ability can be used if the attacker inflicts a curse, disease, or poison that deals ability damage or drain, but only if it deals that damage immediately, with no onset time. If the trick is triggered by the subject gaining a condition, the subject is still affected by the condition, but the attacker takes a condition of the mesmerist's choice for 1 round. This condition must come from the minor condition or moderate condition lists of the touch treatment class feature. The enemy can attempt a Will save to avoid gaining the condition. The mesmerist doesn't need to have touch treatment to select or use this trick.	SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Shadow Splinter		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Shadow Splinter		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:The mesmerist protects the subject against an attack and redirects the harm to someone else. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage from an attack. The damage the subject takes is reduced by %1 (to a maximum of the total amount of damage the attack deals). Another creature within range of the original attack, other than the attacker, is affected by a shadow illusion that makes it appear as if the attacker is attacking that creature instead of the attacker's actual target. This second creature takes an amount of damage equal to the amount by which the attack's damage was reduced. This shadow doesn't require a roll to hit and ignores cover and concealment, but the target can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. If it succeeds at this save, it neither takes the damage nor believes the attacker targeted it. This trick can't be triggered if there's no eligible second creature within range to take the redirected damage. This is an illusion (shadow) effect.|3+CHA																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.42
Spectral Smoke		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Spectral Smoke		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:A cloud of smoke pops up around the subject, foiling attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked by an attack or by a spell that requires an attack roll. A smoke cloud appears in the subject's square and in a %1-foot radius around it. This cloud lasts for %2 round(s). The cloud functions as fog cloud, but is an illusion (figment) effect that can't be dispersed by wind and can be used underwater. A creature that interacts with the cloud can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect.|min(10+5*floor(MesmeristLVL/5),30)|MesmeristLVL																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.42
Vanish Arrow		KEY:Mesmerist Trick ~ Vanish Arrow			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristTrick.SpecialQuality	DESC:With a flourish, the mesmerist snatches a projectile from an enemy before it can be shot. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by a ranged weapon attack, before the attack roll is made. The mesmerist attempts a Sleight of Hand check opposed by the attacker's Perception check. If the mesmerist succeeds, that ranged attack automatically misses, and the projectile appears stowed on the mesmerist's person. If the attacker is making a full attack, this affects only one of the attacks (of the mesmerist's choice). If the attack is made with a javelin or other thrown weapon, the attacker gains a +4 bonus on its Perception check. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects are not affected by this ability.

Psychic Inception	KEY:Bold Stare ~ Psychic Inception	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoldStare.SpecialQuality	DESC:The hypnotic stare and its penalty can affect creatures that are mindless or immune to mind-affecting effects (such as an undead or vermin). The mesmerist can also partially affect such a creature with his mind-affecting spells and abilities if it's under the effect of his hypnotic stare; it gains a +2 bonus on its saving throw (if any), and if affected, it still has a 50%% chance each round of ignoring the effect. Ignoring the effect doesn't end the effect, but does allow the creature to act normally for that round.	SOURCEPAGE:p.43

The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is affected by a charm or compulsion effect created by an enemy. The subject acts as thought the mesmerist had cast the spell instead of the enemy. For instance, if the subject were affected by charm monster cast by an enemy, that enemy can't try to give her orders, but the mesmerist could. If the charm or compulsion causes penalties or conditions (such as those imposed by confusion, crushing despair, or hold person), the subject can ignore any of those penalties or conditions the mesmerist chooses. This trick overrides the charm or compulsion for %1 rounds or until the duration of the triggering effect elapses, whichever comes first. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.

When the mesmerist implants this trick, he must expend expend one spell slot to couple a spell he knows of that level with the trick. That spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less and be able to target one creature (spells like dominate person that have more restrictive targeting can be used, but have no effect if triggered against creatures that don't match). He can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by an enemy's spell. The mesmerist's spell then triggers, affecting only the enemy spellcaster. This takes effect only if the enemy spellcaster is within range of the spell (as measured from the subject of the trick), and functions as though the mesmerist were in the subject's square. The enemy's spell still has its full effect, even if the mesmerist's spell would normally protect against it or make the caster unable to cast it. (Masterful Trick)	SOURCEPAGE:p.44

# Occultist
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Occultist ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:An occultist is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).
Spells				KEY:Occultist ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:An occultist casts psychic spells drawn from the occultist spell list presented on page 58, limited by the implement groups he knows. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every occultist spell has an implement component (see Implements on page 47). To learn or cast a spell, an occultist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an occultist's spell equals 10 + the spell level + the occultist's Intelligence modifier. An occultist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-6: Occultist. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). The occultist's selection of spells is limited. For each implement school he learns to use, he can add one spell of each level he can cast to his list of spells known, chosen from that school's spell list. If he selects the same implement school multiple times, he adds one spell of each level from that school's list for each time he has selected that school. When the occultist learns to cast a new level of spells, he immediately adds one spell of that level to his list of spells known from each implement school he knows (plus any extra spells from schools he has selected multiple times). At 5th level and every 3 occultist levels thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), an occultist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the occultist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level occultist spell the occultist can cast. The spell learned must come from the same list of spells provided by the implement school of the spell lost. An occultist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for that level. An occultist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.
Focus Powers			KEY:Occultist ~ Focus Powers				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	DESC:At 1st level, an occultist learns the base focus power from both of his two implement schools (see Implements below) and can select one more focus power from the list of those available to him through those schools. Whenever the occultist learns a new implement school, he gains the base power of that school. In addition, at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, he learns a new focus power selected from the options granted by all of the implement schools he knows. The occultist can use focus powers only by expending mental focus (see Mental Focus on page 48). Unless otherwise noted, the DC for any saving throw against a focus power equals 10 + 1/2 the occultist's level + the occultist's Intelligence modifier. The occultist can't select a focus power more than once. Some focus powers require him to reach a specific occultist level before he can choose them.
Implements				KEY:Occultist ~ Implements				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	DESC:At 1st level, an occultist learns to use two implement schools. At 2nd level and every 4 occultist levels thereafter, the occultist learns to use one additional implement school, to a maximum of seven schools at 18th level. Each implement school adds one spell per spell level of that school of magic to the occultist's spell list. No spells from any other school are considered to be on the occultist's spell list until he selects the associated implement school. He can't use spell trigger or spell completion magic items from unknown schools without succeeding at the appropriate Use Magic Device check. An occultist can select an implement school more than once in order to learn additional spells from the associated school. Each implement school is represented by a small list of objects. Every day, the occultist selects one item from that school's list to be his implement for the day for each implement school he knows. The occultist needs only one such item to cast spells of the corresponding school, unless he selected that implement school multiple times, in which case he needs one item for each set of spells gained from that school. Implements don't need to be magic items, and nonmagical implements don't take up a magic item slot even if they're worn. Implements that are not magic items are often of some historical value or of personal significance to the occultist, such as the finger bone of a saint, the broken scepter of a long-dead king, the skull of a mentor's familiar, or the glass eye of an uncanny ancestor. Whenever an occultist casts a spell, he must have the corresponding implement in his possession and present the implement to the target or toward the area of effect. This act is part of casting the spell and doesn't require any additional action. If the occultist lacks the corresponding implement, he can attempt to cast the spell, but must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + the spell's level) to do so. Spells cast by an occultist without the appropriate implement are always treated as if they were cast at the minimum caster level for the spell in question (caster level 1st for a 1st-level spell, caster level 4th for a 2nd-level spell, and so on). Each implement school also grants a base focus power. This power is added to the list of focus powers possessed by the occultist (see Mental Focus below). In addition, each implement school grants access to a number of other focus powers that the occultist can select from using his mental focus class feature. See the Implement Schools section starting on page 50 for a complete list of implements associated with each school and their focus powers.
Knacks				KEY:Occultist ~ Knacks					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:An occultist learns one knack, or 0-level psychic spell, each time he selects an implement school (including when he again selects a school that he has already learned to use). These spells are cast like any other spell, but they can be cast any number of times per day. Knacks cast using any other spell slots because of metamagic feats applied to them, for example, consume spell slots as normal.
Mental Focus			KEY:Occultist ~ Mental Focus				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:An occultist can invest a portion of his mental focus into his chosen implements for the day, allowing him to utilize a variety of abilities depending on the implements and the amount of mental focus invested in them. An occultist has a number of points of mental focus equal to his occultist level + his Intelligence modifier; these points refresh each day. He can divide this mental focus between his implements in any way he desires. If an implement is lost or destroyed, the focus invested in it is lost as well, though the occultist still refreshes those points of focus normally. Once mental focus is invested inside an implement, the implement gains the resonant power of its implement school (see page 50), and the occultist can expend the mental focus stored in the implement to activate the associated focus powers he knows. If a resonant power grants a bonus that varies based on the amount of mental focus invested in the implement, the bonus is determined when the focus is invested, and is not reduced or altered by expending the mental focus invested in the item. Once all of the mental focus in an implement has been expended, it loses its resonant power until mental focus is once again invested in the implement. The implement grants its resonant power to whoever possesses it; the occultist can lend the implement to an ally to assist that ally, but if he does so, he has difficulty casting that implement's spells (see Implements on page 47) and can't expend that implement's focus on focus powers until he retrieves the implement or refreshes his focus. The occultist refreshes his mental focus once each day after receiving at least 8 hours of sleep. After refreshing his mental focus, the occultist must spend 1 hour preparing his implements and investing them with this power. Mental focus that is not used before the next time the occultist refreshes his focus is lost. The occultist can choose to save generic mental focus inside his own body instead of investing all of it, but expending this focus comes at a higher cost. Any focus power the occultist activates with generic focus costs twice as much mental focus to use (and to maintain, if applicable). The occultist can expend his generic focus through an appropriate implement on any focus power he knows, but an implement he didn't invest any focus in at the start of the day grants no resonant power.
Magic Item Skill			KEY:Occultist ~ Magic Item Skill			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:At 2nd level, an occultist's knowledge of magic items grants him a bonus when attempting to use them. He gains a bonus on all Use Magic Device checks equal to 1/2 his occultist level.
Object Reading			KEY:Occultist ~ Object Reading			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:At 2nd level, an occultist learns how to read information from items he examines. Examining an item in this way requires him to spend 1 minute handling the item. If the item is a magic item, the occultist learns its properties and command word as if he had successfully examined the item using detect magic and succeeded at a Spellcraft check. This ability does not reveal whether the item is cursed unless the occultist's class level is equal to or greater than the caster level of the item. If the item has any historical significance, the occultist learns one piece of information about its past (as determined by the GM). Finally, if the item was last used no longer than 1 day ago per the occultist's class level, the occultist learns one piece of information about the last creature to use the item. This information might be a glimpse of the creature's appearance, a brief vision of what it saw while using the item, or perhaps its emotional state when it last used the item. The GM determines what information is gained in this way. This functions like the psychometry occult skill unlock (see page 196), but doesn't require a skill check and can be used at will.
Shift Focus				KEY:Occultist ~ Shift Focus				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:At 4th level, an occultist gains the ability to shift his mental focus from one implement to another, though some of the focus is lost along the way. Shifting mental focus removes a number of points of mental focus from one implement and adds the same number - 1 to another implement; this takes 1 minute of quiet contemplation while touching both implements. The occultist can shift his mental focus only from one implement to another implement; he can't shift generic focus into an implement. Unlike expending focus normally, this shift can reduce the effect of a resonant power in the implement from which the mental focus was taken. It does not, however, add to the resonant power of the implement to which the focus is added.
Aura Sight				KEY:Occultist ~ Aura Sight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	DESC:At 5th level, the occultist can read the auras of creatures around him as a standard action. This functions as the aura sightACG spell with a duration of 1 round.
Magic Circles			KEY:Occultist ~ Magic Circles				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	DESC:At 8th level, an occultist learns how to draw magic circles. To draw a circle, he must have chalk, salt, blood, powdered silver, or some other appropriate substance at hand (although he can press a magic circle into a softer surface such as dirt or clay). Drawing a circle takes 1 minute and requires the occultist to expend 1 point of mental focus (either generic focus or focus from any one of his implements). Once completed, this circle functions as a permanent magic circle against any alignment of the occultist's choosing. The circle can't be against a component of the occultist's alignment (if he is lawful good, for example, it can't be a magic circle against good or law). The circle remains until its form is physically broken (for example, if the lines are smeared or the salt is scattered). Only a living creature can break the circle; environmental effects can't break it. An occultist can have only one circle created in this way at a time. If he creates a second circle, the first one loses all its magic powers. This type of magic circle can't normally be focused inward to bind an outsider.
Outside Contact			KEY:Occultist ~ Outside Contact			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	DESC:At 8th level, the occultist learns the true name of one particular outsider. This outsider can have no more than 3 Hit Dice. Whenever the occultist creates a magic circle, he can expend 1 additional point of mental focus to focus the circle inward and lure that outsider to the circle (similar to using lesser planar binding). The outsider is bound for up to 10 minutes. During this time, the occultist can bargain with the outsider for one piece of information. This requires a payment of at least 20 gp (or items of at least that value that are of interest to the outsider). The bargaining requires the occultist to attempt a Diplomacy or Intimidate check opposed by the outsider's Sense Motive check. Succeeding at the check by 5 or more reduces this cost to 10 gp. Failure increases the price to 30 gp, whereas failure by 5 or more allows the outsider to escape without giving any information (or receiving payment). The information gained can be anything that might be learned through a divination spell. The information is always correct but is frequently cryptic. It typically takes the outsider 1d3 hours to gather the information, at which point it returns of its own accord to deliver the information as promised. The outsider always resents being used in this way, even if the occultist and the outsider share an alignment component. After the occultist bargains with the outsider, the magic circle loses all power and the outsider is sent back to its home plane. At 12th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the occultist learns to contact one additional outsider of the same type or a different type. Although he can call only one outsider in this way at a time, the occultist can ask such an outsider one additional question per calling for every 4 occultist levels he possesses beyond 8th (to a maximum of four questions at 20th level), all for the same bargaining price. The questions must be in some way related to one another. At 16th level, in lieu of asking questions, the occultist can demand that the outsider deliver a message to any one friendly creature that the occultist knows personally. The occultist can also task the outsider to deliver one object weighing no more than 1 pound. Either of these demands requires an opposed check as described above. Delivery typically takes 1d4 hours, but this period is reduced to 1d6 minutes if the recipient is within 1 mile of the occultist (or even less if the recipient is within sight). The occultist must be able to accurately describe the recipient in both name and appearance. This ability can't be used to deliver anything to a location, or to enemies or creatures that are unfriendly to the occultist.
Binding Circles			KEY:Occultist ~ Binding Circles			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	DESC:At 12th level, whenever the occultist creates a magic circle he can expend 1 additional point of mental focus to make it a binding circle. A binding circle is invisible and counts as a trap. If a living creature of the corresponding alignment steps inside it, the trap triggers and binds the creature inside the circle. While it can move freely within the circle, it can't leave the circle, make attacks against targets outside the circle, cast spells that cross the circle's boundary (the circle blocks line of effect from the inside), or use any ability that would allow it to leave the circle or disturb the circle in any way. When the circle traps a creature in this way, the creature can attempt a Ref lex save to dive out of the circle before the magic takes hold (DC = 10 + 1/2 the occultist's level + the occultist's Intelligence modifier). A creature that can see the circle gains a +4 bonus on this save. If it fails its save, the creature must remain in the circle, although it can attempt a Will save at the same DC at the end of each hour of imprisonment to escape. A binding circle can be spotted with a successful Perception check (DC = 25 + 1/2 the occultist's level). It can also be disarmed using Disable Device, with the same DC. Anything crossing the boundary of the circle from the outside, such as a weapon, spell effect, or special ability, immediately breaks the circle and frees the creature trapped inside.
Fast Circles			KEY:Occultist ~ Fast Circles				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	DESC:At 16th level, the occultist learns to draw magic circles very quickly. He can draw a magic circle as a full-round action, but any circle drawn in this way has a duration of 1 minute per occultist level (unless it's drawn in conjunction with the outside contact class feature, in which case it lasts for 10 minutes as normal). If he draws a binding circle in this way, its duration is 1 round per occultist level.
Implement Mastery			KEY:Occultist ~ Implement Mastery			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Occultist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	DESC:At 20th level, an occultist learns to master one of his implements. He selects one implement school. Whenever he uses a focus power from an implement of that school, the DC to resist any of the effects increases by 4 and he treats his occultist level as 4 higher when determining the effects and duration of that power. In addition, the occultist gains 4 extra points of mental focus, but these points must always be invested in implements of the mastered school. He can't save these points or expend them for any ability other than the focus powers of those implements. The hardness of each of the occultist's implements of the mastered school increases by an additional 20 as long as the item has at least 1 point of mental focus stored within.

Spells				KEY:Psychic ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.60	DESC:A psychic casts psychic spells drawn from the psychic class's spell list (see page 69). She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a psychic must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a psychic's spell is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the psychic's Intelligence modifier. A psychic can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-7: Psychic. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). The psychic's selection of spells is limited. A psychic begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the psychic's choice. At each new psychic level, she learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-8: Psychic Spells Known. Unlike a psychic's spells per day, the number of spells a psychic knows isn't affected by her Intelligence score; the numbers on Table 1-8 are fixed. At 4th level and every even-numbered level thereafter (6th, 8th, and so on), a psychic can choose to learn a single new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the psychic loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell from the psychic's class list that the psychic can cast. A psychic can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. A psychic need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any psychic spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.
Knacks				KEY:Psychic ~ Knacks					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.60	DESC:Psychics learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1-8. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they don't consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots (due to metamagic feats, for example) consume spell slots as normal.
Phrenic Pool			KEY:Psychic ~ Phrenic Pool				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.60	DESC:A psychic has a pool of supernatural mental energy that she can draw upon to manipulate psychic spells as she casts them. The maximum number of points in a psychic's phrenic pool is equal to 1/2 her psychic level + her Wisdom or Charisma modifier, as determined by her psychic discipline. The phrenic pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours don't need to be consecutive. The psychic might be able to recharge points in her phrenic pool in additional circumstances dictated by her psychic discipline. Points gained in excess of the pool's maximum are lost.
Phrenic Amplifications		KEY:Psychic ~ Phrenic Amplifications		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.60	DESC:A psychic develops particular techniques to empower her spellcasting, called phrenic amplif ications. The psychic can activate a phrenic amplification only while casting a spell using psychic magic, and the amplification modifies either the spell's effects or the process of casting it. The spell being cast is called the linked spell. The psychic can activate only one amplification each time she casts a spell, and doing so is part of the action used to cast the spell. She can use any amplification she knows with any psychic spell, unless the amplification's description states that it can be linked only to certain types of spells. A psychic learns one phrenic amplification at 1st level, selected from the list below. At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, the psychic learns a new phrenic amplification. A phrenic amplification can't be selected more than once. Once a phrenic amplification has been selected, it can't be changed. Phrenic amplifications require the psychic to expend 1 or more points from her phrenic pool to function.
Psychic Discipline (Ex or Sp)	KEY:Psychic ~ Psychic Discipline			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.62	DESC:Each psychic accesses and improves her mental powers through a particular method, such as rigorous study or attaining a particular mental state. This is called her psychic discipline. She gains additional spells known based on her selected discipline. The choice of discipline must be made at 1st level; once made, it can't be changed. Each psychic discipline gives the psychic a number of discipline powers (at 1st, 5th, and 13th levels), and grants her additional spells known. In addition, the discipline determines which ability score the psychic uses for her phrenic pool and phrenic amplifications abilities. The DC of a saving throw against a psychic discipline ability equals 10 + 1/2 the psychic's level + the psychic's Intelligence modifier. At 1st level, a psychic learns an additional spell determined by her discipline. She learns another additional spell at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, until learning the final one at 18th level. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1-8. Spells learned from a discipline can't be exchanged for different spells at higher levels. Specific psychic disciplines are further described starting on page 64.
Detect Thoughts			KEY:Psychic ~ Detect Thoughts				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:At 2nd level, a psychic can use detect thoughts as a spell-like ability once per day. She can also expend any unused spell slot of 1st level or higher to cast detect thoughts. If she does so, she uses the level of the spell slot expended to determine the Will save DC. When a psychic gains this ability, if she knows detect thoughts, she can learn a different 1st-level spell in place of detect thoughts, losing the old spell in exchange for the new one.
Telepathic Bond			KEY:Psychic ~ Telepathic Bond				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:At 9th level, a psychic can use telepathic bond as a spell-like ability once per day, using her psychic level as her caster level. She can't leave herself out of a bond created in this way. She can also expend any unused spell slot of 4th level or higher to cast telepathic bond. Casting the spell using a higher-level spell slot gives no benefit on its own, but the psychic can apply metamagic feats that would increase the spell level to the appropriate level. For instance, if the psychic knows Extend Spell, she can use a 5th-level spell slot to cast extended telepathic bond as a full-round action. When a psychic who knows telepathic bond gains this ability, she can learn a different 4th-level spell in place of telepathic bond, losing the old spell in exchange for the new one.
Major Amplifications		KEY:Psychic ~ Major Amplifications			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:At 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a psychic can choose one of the following major amplifications in place of a phrenic amplification.
Telepathy				KEY:Psychic ~ Telepathy					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:At 17th level, the psychic can mentally communicate with any other creature within 100 feet that has a language. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than one creature at a time is just as difficult as both speaking and listening to multiple people at the same time. When a psychic who knows telepathy (see page 189) gains this ability, she can learn a different 5th-level spell in place of telepathy, losing the old spell in exchange for the new one.
Remade Self				KEY:Psychic ~ Remade Self				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Psychic Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:At 20th level, the psychic is affected by one of the following spells as a constant spell-like ability: arcane sight, f ly, haste, heroism, nondetection, or tongues. This ability is chosen when the psychic reaches 20th level and can't be changed. While the psychic is under the effects of this spell-like ability, each time she casts a psychic spell, she can link one phrenic amplification or major amplification she knows that has a point cost of 1 to that spell without spending any points from her phrenic pool. This amplification is in addition to the normal maximum of one amplification per spell.

For example, if the linked spell were nondetection, the DC of the caster level check for using a divination on the warded creature or item would increase. This increase also applies to checks to dispel, counterspell, or identify the linked spell. The bonus applies while the spell is cast and lasts for the spell's duration (if appropriate), to a maximum of 24 hours. The psychic can choose to spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to instead increase the linked spell's DCs by 4.
Conjured Armor			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Conjured Armor			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.61	DESC:By spending 1 point from her phrenic pool, the psychic grants any creature she conjures or summons with the linked spell a +2 def lection bonus to AC. This bonus lasts for 1 round per caster level or until the creature disappears, whichever comes first. This amplification can be linked only to conjuration (calling) or conjuration (summoning) spells. The bonus increases to +3 at 8th level and to +4 at 15th level.
Defensive Prognostication	KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Defensive Prognostication		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.61	DESC:When casting a divination spell, the psychic sees a glimmer of her future. By spending 1 point from her phrenic pool as she casts a divination spell, she gains a +2 insight bonus to AC for a number of rounds equal to the linked spell's level. She can instead spend 2 points to increase the bonus to +4. This amplification can be linked only to divination spells.
Focused Force			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Focused Force				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.61	DESC:When casting a force spell, the psychic can increase the spell's damage by spending 1 point from her phrenic pool. Increase the die size for the spell's damage by one step (from 1d4 to 1d6, 1d6 to 1d8, 1d8 to 1d10, or 1d10 to 1d12). This increases the size of each die rolled, so a spell that dealt 4d6+3 points of force damage would deal 4d8+3 points of force damage instead. This amplification can be linked only to spells that deal force damage, and only if that damage includes a die value. A spell that already uses d12s for damage can't be amplified in this way.
Intense Focus			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Intense Focus				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.61	DESC:The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to gain a +2 bonus on any concentration check she attempts as part of casting the linked spell. She can choose to spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to instead gain a +4 bonus.
Mindshield				KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Mindshield				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.61	DESC:The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to give one target of the linked spell a +2 morale bonus on Will saves for 1 round per psychic level (maximum 10 rounds). The psychic can instead spend 2 points to increase the bonus to +4. If the linked spell affects more than one creature, the psychic can spend the same number of points for each additional creature she wants to affect with this amplification. She must choose to spend either 1 point for each creature or 2 points for each creature; she can't grant different bonuses to different targets.
Mindtouch				KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Mindtouch				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.61	DESC:The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to probe one target's mind if that creature is affected by the linked spell. If the target of the linked spell fails its saving throw or is hit by the spell, the psychic detects its surface thoughts (as the 3rd-round effect of detect thoughts). If the linked spell doesn't already require an attack roll or allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid the thought-detection effect only; the DC is calculated using the linked spell's level (and all other bonuses that would apply if the linked spell allowed a Will save). This amplification can be linked only to spells that affect a target or an area. If the linked spell can affect more than one creature, the psychic can attempt to detect more than one target's thoughts by spending 1 additional point per creature beyond the first. She must select these targets when she casts the spell and spends the points. This is a mind-affecting effect.
Ongoing Defense			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Ongoing Defense			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.61	DESC:The psychic can increase the duration of spells that improve her psychic defenses. She can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool when she casts any intellect fortress, mental barrier, thought shield, or tower of iron will spell to extend the spell's duration by 1 round.
Overpowering Mind			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Overpowering Mind			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.62	DESC:The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to increase the Will save DC of the linked spell by 1. At 8th level, she can choose to instead spend 4 points to increase the DC by 2. At 15th level, she can choose to instead spend 6 points to increase the DC by 3. This amplification can be linked only to spells that have the mind-affecting descriptor and require a Will saving throw.
Relentless Casting		KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Relentless Casting			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.62	DESC:The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to roll twice on any caster level checks to overcome spell resistance required for the linked spell and take the better result. Because she must decide to spend points from her phrenic pool when she starts casting a spell, the psychic must decide to use this ability before the GM calls for the caster level check.
Undercast Surge			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Undercast Surge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.62	DESC:When the psychic undercasts a spell (see page 144), she can spend points from her phrenic pool to increase the spell's effective level, essentially using up a lower-level spell slot to cast a higher-level version of the spell. This costs 2 points per spell level increased. She can't use this ability to cast a version higher than the version she knows. For instance, a psychic who knows mind thrust III but not mind thrust IV could cast mind thrust II and spend 2 points to treat it as mind thrust III, but couldn't spend 4 points to treat it as mind thrust IV. This amplification can be linked only to spells that can be undercast.
Will of the Dead			KEY:Phrenic Amplification ~ Will of the Dead			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Phrenic Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.62	DESC:Even undead creatures can be affected by the psychic's mind-affecting spells. The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to overcome an undead creature's immunity to mind-affecting effects for the purposes of the linked spell. This ability functions even on mindless undead, but has no effect on creatures that aren't undead. This amplification can be linked only to spells that have the mind-affecting descriptor.
# Major Amplifications	
# COMMENT: no pool implemented yet
Dispelling Pulse			KEY:Major Amplification ~ Dispelling Pulse			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:The psychic can spend 3 points from her phrenic pool to entwine dispelling magic with a targeted spell. If the target is hit by the linked spell or fails its saving throw, it's affected as though the psychic had cast a targeted dispel magic spell on it. This effect can dispel only spells of the linked spell's level or lower. If the linked spell doesn't already require an attack roll or allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid the dispelling effect only; the DC is calculated using the linked spell's level (and all other bonuses that would apply if the linked spell allowed a Will save). This amplification can be linked only to a spell that targets one creature or object.
Dual Amplification		KEY:Major Amplification ~ Dual Amplification			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:When the psychic uses this major amplification, she chooses two other amplifications or major amplifications she knows to apply to the same linked spell. She must spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to do so, plus the full cost of the two other amplifications. She can't apply the same amplification to the linked spell more than once, even if she can use that amplification for multiple different effects.
Mimic Metamagic			KEY:Major Amplification ~ Mimic Metamagic				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:When the psychic gains this amplification, she chooses two metamagic feats; she need not have these feats to select them. When she casts a spell, she can spend points from her phrenic pool to apply one of the chosen feats to the linked spell without increasing the spell's level or casting time. She must spend a number of points equal to double the number of levels by which the feat normally increases a spell's level (minimum 2 points). If the metamagic feat alters the spell's casting time in a different way than the standard rules for a spontaneous caster using a metamagic feat (as in the case of Quicken Spell), it changes the casting time accordingly. The psychic can still apply metamagic feats she knows to the spell while using this amplification, increasing the casting time and spell level as normal. This amplification can be applied only to a spell that the chosen metamagic feat could normally affect, and only if the spellcaster can cast spells of a high enough level that she would be able to apply the metamagic feat in question to the linked spell. For example, an 11th-level psychic could spend 8 points to quicken a 1st-level spell, but couldn't quicken a 2nd-level spell because she's unable to cast 6th-level spells. This ability doesn't require her to have any free spell slots in the relevant level, however, so the psychic in the example could quicken a 1st-level spell even if she had cast all her 5th-level spells for the day. A psychic can select this amplification multiple times, adding two additional options to the list of metamagic feats she can apply using this amplification each time.
Space-rending Spell		KEY:Major Amplification ~ Space-rending Spell			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:The psychic can warp space with her mind, teleporting herself as she casts her linked spell. She teleports herself 10 feet per point she spends from her phrenic pool (as dimension door). The maximum number of points she can spend in this way is equal to the linked spell's level.
Subordinate Spell			KEY:Major Amplification ~ Subordinate Spell			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:The psychic can divide her mind to cast a less powerful spell upon herself alongside her linked spell. The linked spell can't be lower than 5th level and can't take less than a standard action to cast. This applies to the actual casting time, so the psychic can't add a subordinate spell to a quickened spell. The subordinate spell's casting time must be 1 standard action or less, and its level can be no higher than the linked spell's level - 5. The subordinate spell must target only the psychic (even if it could normally affect other or multiple targets). The psychic must spend a number of points from her phrenic pool equal to 3 + double the subordinate spell's level. The subordinate spell acts as though it had been cast, and uses up one of the psychic's spells per day of its level. The effects of the two spells are separate, so each might require its own concentration check.
Synaptic Shock			KEY:Major Amplification ~ Synaptic Shock				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:The psychic manipulates an enemy's mind with brute force, causing mental harm beyond that done by her linked spell. She can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool when casting a mind-affecting linked spell to select one of the spell's targets. If the target is affected by the linked spell, that target is confused for 1 round after the duration of the spell expires (or immediately, if the spell has an instantaneous duration). If the target succeeds at its save against the linked spell, it is instead confused for 1 round immediately. For each additional point the psychic spends from her phrenic pool, she can confuse one additional target of the linked spell. This amplification can be applied only to a mind-affecting spell that can affect a number of targets or that has an area. It has no effect on creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects, unless the linked spell is able to affect such creatures (such as a spell that has both will of the dead and synaptic shock applied to it via dual amplification).
Turning Shield			KEY:Major Amplification ~ Turning Shield				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Major Amplification.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:The psychic can turn her excess spell energy into a barrier that def lects weaker spells. She can spend a number of points from her phrenic pool equal to the linked spell's level to gain the benefit of spell turning for 1 round per psychic level. The number of spell levels she can turn is equal to the level of the linked spell.


###Block: Spiritualist
Weapon and Armor Proficiency			KEY:Spiritualist ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:A spiritualist is proficient with all simple weapons, kukris, saps, and scythes, as well as with light armor.
Spells						KEY:Spiritualist ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:A spiritualist casts psychic spells drawn from the spiritualist spell list (see page 76). She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level. To learn or cast a spell, a spiritualist must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a spiritualist's spell equals 10 + the spell level + the spiritualist's Wisdom modifier. A spiritualist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-9: Spiritualist. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). A spiritualist's selection of spells is limited. A spiritualist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the spiritualist's choice. At each new spiritualist level, she learns one or more new spells as indicated on Table 1-10: Spiritualist Spells Known. Unlike her number of spells per day, the number of spells a spiritualist knows does not affect her Wisdom score. The numbers on Table 1-10 are fixed. Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third spiritualist level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a spiritualist can learn a single new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the spiritualist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spiritualist spell she can cast. A spiritualist can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level.
Knacks						KEY:Spiritualist ~ Knacks					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:A spiritualist learns a number of knacks, or 0-level psychic spells, as noted on Table 1-10 under Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they can be cast any number of times per day. Knacks prepared using another spell slot, because of metamagic feats applied to them, for example, consume spell slots as normal.
Phantom						KEY:Spiritualist ~ Phantom					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:A spiritualist begins play with the aid of a powerful and versatile spirit entity called a phantom. The phantom forms a link with the spiritualist, who forever after can either harbor the creature within her consciousness or manifest it as an ectoplasmic or incorporeal entity. A phantom has the same alignment as the spiritualist, and it can speak all the languages its master can. A spiritualist can harbor her phantom in her consciousness (see the shared consciousness class feature on page 73), manifest it partially (see the bonded manifestation class feature on page 74), or fully manifest it. A fully manifested phantom is treated as a summoned creature from the Ethereal Plane, except it is not sent back to the Ethereal Plane until it is reduced to a negative amount of hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. A spiritualist can fully manifest her phantom through a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When the phantom is fully manifested, the spiritualist can change the form of the phantom's manifestation (either from ectoplasmic to incorporeal or vice versa) as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. When the phantom manifests, its hit points are unchanged from the last time it manifested, unless the phantom was slain and returned to the Ethereal Plane; in this case, the phantom manifests with half its maximum number of hit points. The phantom does not heal naturally, and can be healed only with magic or by being tended to with the Heal skill while fully manifested in ectoplasmic form. The phantom stays fully manifested until it is either returned to the spiritualist's consciousness (a standard action) or banished to the Ethereal Plane. If the phantom is banished to the Ethereal Plane, it can't return to the spiritualist's consciousness or manifest again for 24 hours. While fully manifested, a phantom can't be returned to the Ethereal Plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment work normally. Whenever the spiritualist is unconscious or asleep, the phantom immediately returns to the spiritualist's consciousness. If the spiritualist dies, the phantom is returned to the Ethereal Plane, and can't return to the spiritualist's consciousness until 24 hours after the spiritualist is brought back to life. A phantom can't be dismissed or banished (by a spell or any other similar effect) while it resides in the spiritualist's consciousness, as the phantom is protected from such effects by the power of the spiritualist's psyche. Fully manifested phantoms can wear armor and use items (though not wield weapons) appropriate to their forms. Any items worn, carried, or held by a phantom are dropped when the phantom returns to the spiritualist's consciousness, and must be retrieved and donned anew if the phantom wishes to use them when it fully manifests in the future. Phantoms are self-involved, even jealous, creatures that do not play well with other summoned companions. A phantom refuses to manifest (either fully or as part of a bonded manifestation; see Bonded Manifestation on page 74) in the presence of an eidolon or shadow summoned by the phantom's master. Furthermore, if a phantom is manifested when such a creature is summoned, it immediately retreats into its spiritualist's consciousness, and will not manifest again until the eidolon or shadow is dismissed. A fully manifested phantom's abilities, feats, Hit Dice, saving throws, and skills are tied to the spiritualist's class level and increase as the spiritualist gains levels. See the Phantoms section starting on page 78 for more information.
Shared Consciousness				KEY:Spiritualist ~ Shared Consciousness			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.73	DESC:At 1st level, while a phantom is confined in a spiritualist's consciousness (but not while it's fully manifested or banished to the Ethereal Plane), it grants the spiritualist the Skill Focus feat in two skills determined by the phantom's emotional focus, unless the spiritualist already has Skill Focus in those skills. It also grants a +4 bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting effects; at 12th level, this bonus increases to +8. Lastly, once per day, when the spiritualist fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, as an immediate action she can shunt that effect into the phantom's section of her consciousness instead. When she does so, she is not affected by the mind-affecting effect, but for the normal duration of that effect, the spiritualist loses the bonuses on saving throws against mind-affecting effects and the Skill Focus effects granted by her phantom, and can't use this ability to shunt a mind-affecting effect into the phantom's consciousness or manifest her phantom in any way. When a mind-affecting effect is shunted into the phantom's consciousness, spells such as dispel magic and break enchantment can be cast on the spiritualist to end the effect's duration as if the spiritualist were affected by the mind-affecting effect.
Etheric Tether					KEY:Spiritualist ~ Etheric Tether				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.74	DESC:At 1st level, a spiritualist can force the phantom to manifest in an area around her by pushing the phantom's consciousness though the veil of ethereal essence, allowing it to fully manifest in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form. Whenever her manifested phantom takes enough damage to send it back to the Ethereal Plane, as a reaction to the damage, the spiritualist can sacrifice any number of her hit points without using an action. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to the phantom. This can prevent the phantom from being sent back to the Ethereal Plane. This tether is limited. When the phantom is fully manifested, it and the spiritualist must remain within 50 feet of one another for the phantom's manifestation to stay stable with little to no concentration on the part of the spiritualist. The spiritualist can stretch the limited tether, but only when the phantom is in ectoplasmic form. When a spiritualist starts her turn and her ectoplasmic phantom is more than 50 feet away from her (but closer than 100 feet), the spiritualist must concentrate on the link as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity or the ectoplasmic phantom immediately returns to the Ethereal Plane and cannot be summoned from that plane for 24 hours. This concentration can be interrupted as if it were a spell. Treat this effect's spell level as equal to 1 + 1 per 10 feet farther than 50 feet that the phantom is from the spiritualist (maximum spell level 6th). If the tether is interrupted or the check fails, the phantom immediately snaps back into the consciousness of its spiritualist master. If the ectoplasmic phantom is ever more than 100 feet away from its spiritualist, or the incorporeal phantom is ever 50 feet away from the spiritualist or outside of line of effect from the spiritualist for more than 1 round per spiritualist level the spiritualist possesses, the tether is automatically broken; the phantom immediately returns to the Ethereal Plane and can't be summoned from that plane for 24 hours. See the Phantoms section starting on page 78 for more information.
Bonded Senses					KEY:Spiritualist ~ Bonded Senses				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.74	DESC:At 2nd level, as a standard action, a spiritualist can share the senses of her manifested phantom, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and feeling everything her phantom does. She can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her spiritualist level, but those rounds do not need to be consecutive. There is no maximum range for this effect, but the phantom and the spiritualist must be on the same plane. The spiritualist can end this effect as a free action.
Bonded Manifestation				KEY:Spiritualist ~ Bonded Manifestation			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.74	DESC:At 3rd level, as a swift action, a spiritualist can pull on the consciousness of her phantom and the substance of the Ethereal Plane to partially manifest aspects of both in her own body. When she does, she uses this bonded manifestation to enhance her own abilities while the phantom is still bound to her consciousness. For the spiritualist to use this ability, the phantom must be confined in the spiritualist's consciousness; it can't be manifested in any other way. During a bonded manifestation, the phantom can't be damaged, dismissed, or banished. A spiritualist can use bonded manifestation a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + her spiritualist level. The rounds need not be consecutive. She can dismiss the effects of a bonded manifestation as a free action, but even if she dismisses a bonded manifestation on the same round that she used it, it counts as 1 round of use. When a spiritualist uses this ability, she must choose either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form. When she makes this choice, she gains all of the abilities based on the form she chooses and her spiritualist level.
Ectoplasmic Bonded Manifestation		KEY:Spiritualist ~ Ectoplasmic Bonded Manifestation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.75	DESC:When a spiritualist uses this ability and chooses ectoplasmic form, she gains an ectoplasmic shield that protects her without restricting her movement or actions. She gains a +4 shield bonus to Armor Class; this bonus applies to incorporeal touch attacks. The ectoplasmic shield has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance. At 8th level, the spiritualist also sprouts a pair of ectoplasmic tendrils from her body. Once per round as either a swift or a standard action (spiritualist's choice), the spiritualist can use one or both tendrils to attack creatures within her melee reach (using the attack bonus and damage dice of her ectoplasmic manifested phantom) or to manipulate objects. She can even use that action to have one tendril make an attack and the other manipulate an object, as long as that object can be manipulated with one hand. At 13th level, the phantom's ectoplasm clings to the spiritualist like a suit of armor. This grants the spiritualist a +6 armor bonus to AC without imposing an armor check penalty, an arcane spell failure chance, or any reduction in speed. At 18th level, the spiritualist can take a full-round action to attack all creatures within her melee reach with her tendrils (using the attack bonus and damage dice of her ectoplasmic manifested phantom). When she does, she rolls the attack roll twice, takes the better of the two results, and uses that as her attack roll result against all creatures within her melee reach. If the better attack roll threatens a critical hit, the spiritualist chooses one target that she hit to confirm the critical hit against. The other attacks that hit are considered normal hits rather than critical threats. Incorporeal Bonded Manifestation: When a spiritualist uses this ability and chooses incorporeal form, she becomes shrouded in a haze of insubstantial mist, granting her concealment against ranged attacks. At 8th level, the spiritualist can better affect incorporeal creatures with melee attacks; her unarmed strikes and melee weapon attacks are treated as if they had the ghost touch magic weapon special ability. At 13th level, the spiritualist can take a standard action to become invisible (as the invisibility spell) until the start of her next turn. At 18th level, the spiritualist gains the incorporeal subtype and a f ly speed of 30 feet (good) while using this form of bonded manifestation. Spiritual Interference (Ex or Su): At 4th level, whenever a spiritualist is within the reach of her ectoplasmic manifested phantom, she gains a +2 shield bonus to her Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on her saving throws. She doesn't gain these bonuses when the ectoplasmic manifested phantom is grappled, helpless, or unconscious. A spiritualist within 30 feet of her incorporeally manifested phantom receives a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against mindaffecting effects. This bonus is a supernatural ability and does not apply if the phantom is unconscious.
Detect Undead					KEY:Spiritualist ~ Detect Undead				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.75	DESC:At 5th level, a spiritualist's connection with the Ethereal Plane becomes so strong that she can use detect undead at will as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to her spiritualist level.
Phantom Recall					KEY:Spiritualist ~ Phantom Recall				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.75	DESC:At 6th level, as either a swift or an immediate action, a spiritualist can call her manifested phantom to her side or back into her consciousness. This ability functions as dimension door, using the spiritualist's class level as the caster level. When the spiritualist calls the phantom in this way, the phantom appears adjacent to the spiritualist (or as close as possible, if all adjacent spaces are occupied). When the spiritualist uses this ability to call the phantom back to her consciousness, she can activate bonded manifestation as part of that action, but doing so costs 1 extra round of bonded manifestation. The spiritualist can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 spiritualist levels she possesses beyond 6th.
Calm Spirit						KEY:Spiritualist ~ Calm Spirit				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.76	DESC:At 7th level, a spiritualist gains the ability to use calm spirit (see page 160) as a spell-like ability once per day. At 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the spiritualist can use this ability an additional time per day (to a maximum of 4 times per day at 19th level).
See Invisibility					KEY:Spiritualist ~ See Invisibility				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.76	DESC:At 9th level, a spiritualist gains the ability to see many things normally hidden from sight. She gains the ability to use see invisibility as a spell-like ability once per day, with a duration of 10 minutes.
Fused Consciousness				KEY:Spiritualist ~ Fused Consciousness			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.76	DESC:At 10th level, a spiritualist always gains the benefits of bonded senses when her phantom is manifested. She also gains the skill ranks and bonus to mind-affecting spells granted by the spirit's emotional focus (see page 80), even when her phantom is manifested. Lastly, she can shunt the effect of a mind-affecting effect into the consciousness of her phantom as the shared consciousness ability even when the phantom is manifested, but doing so causes the phantom to immediately retreat back into the spiritualist's consciousness.
Greater Spiritual Interference (Ex or Su)	KEY:Spiritualist ~ Greater Spiritual Interference	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.76	DESC:At 12th level, whenever allies are within the phantom's reach, as long as the manifested phantom is in ectoplasmic form, each ally gains a +2 shield bonus to its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. For the spiritualist, these bonuses increase to +4. The spiritualist and allies within range don't gain this bonus if the manifested phantom is grappled, helpless, or unconscious. While the phantom is incorporeally manifested, allies within 30 feet of the phantom receive a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. For the spiritualist, this bonus increases to +4. This bonus doesn't apply if the phantom is unconscious.
Spiritual Bond					KEY:Spiritualist ~ Spiritual Bond				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.76	DESC:At 14th level, a spiritualist's life force becomes intrinsically linked with the phantom's spiritual essence. As long as the phantom has 1 or more hit points, when the spiritualist takes damage that would reduce her to fewer than 0 hit points, those points of damage are transferred to the phantom instead. This transfer stops after the phantom takes all the points of damage or the phantom is reduced to a negative amount of hit points equal to its Constitution score. In the latter case, points of damage dealt in excess of this limit are dealt to the spiritualist. This ability affects only effects that deal hit point damage.
Call Spirit						KEY:Spiritualist ~ Call Spirit				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spiritualist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.76	DESC:At 16th level, a spiritualist gains the ability to use call spirit (see page 160) as a spell-like ability once per day.
