# TODO: not immediately clear how to do the "prereq passing" aspect of Consummate Liar
Consummate Liar			KEY:Mesmerist ~ Consummate Liar			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DEFINE:ConsummateLiarBonus|0	DESC:A mesmerist adds %1 as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn't have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.|ConsummateLiarBonus	BONUS:VAR|ConsummateLiarBonus|max(MesmeristLVL/2,1)	BONUS:SKILL|Bluff|ConsummateLiarBonus																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.39
Hypnotic Stare			KEY:Mesmerist ~ Hypnotic Stare			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:HypnoticStarePenalty|0	DESC:A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a -%1 penalty on Will saving throws. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target's mind; the creature doesn't remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist's focus than the target's perception of his stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists' stares don't stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches' evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.|HypnoticStarePenalty	BONUS:VAR|HypnoticStarePenalty|2	BONUS:VAR|HypnoticStarePenalty|1|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,8	SOURCEPAGE:p.39
Knacks				KEY:Mesmerist ~ Knacks					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																	DESC:Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.	SOURCEPAGE:p.39

Each day, he can implant %1 of these tricks. He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).&nl; To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick's description), even if it isn't his turn. The subject must be within medium range (%2 feet) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick's triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn't need line of sight to trigger it-but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.&nl; Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can't be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick's entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is %3.&nl; The mesmerist knows %4 trick(s). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick's description, a mesmerist can't choose a particular trick more than once.|MesmeristTricksPerDay|MesmeristTrickRange|MesmeristTrickDC|MesmeristTricksKnown	BONUS:VAR|MesmeristTricksPerDay|max(MesmeristLVL/2,1)+max(CHA,0)+MesmeristTrickFCB/3	BONUS:VAR|MesmeristTrickRange|100+(MesmeristLVL*10)	BONUS:VAR|MesmeristTrickDC|10+MesmeristLVL/2+CHA	BONUS:VAR|MesmeristTricksKnown|MesmeristLVL/2+1	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Mesmerist Trick Choice|MesmeristTricksKnown	SOURCEPAGE:p.39	ASPECT:CheckType|Tricks per Day	ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|MesmeristTricksPerDay	ASPECT:MasterAbility|Mesmerist ~ Mesmerist Tricks

Bold Stare				KEY:Mesmerist ~ Bold Stare				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural									DEFINE:BoldStaresKnown|0	DESC:A mesmerist's hypnotic stare imposes further effects upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can't be changed later. The mesmerist can't choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist's bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist's hypnotic stare.

Touch Treatment			KEY:Mesmerist ~ Touch Treatment			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural									DEFINE:TouchTreatmentsPerDay|0	DESC:The mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions-especially those that affect their minds-by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment %1 times per day. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability from the following list: fascinated, shaken|TouchTreatmentsPerDay	DESC:, confused, dazed, frightened, sickened|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,6	DESC:, cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,10	DESC:.

This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.|PREVARGTEQ:MesmeristLVL,14	BONUS:VAR|TouchTreatmentsPerDay|3+CHA	SOURCEPAGE:p.43
Manifold Tricks			KEY:Mesmerist ~ Manifold Tricks			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural									DEFINE:ManifoldTricksCount|0	DESC:The mesmerist can have %1 tricks implanted at a time. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist's tricks).|ManifoldTricksCount	BONUS:VAR|ManifoldTricksCount|2+(MesmeristLVL-5)/4	SOURCEPAGE:p.43
Mental Potency			KEY:Mesmerist ~ Mental Potency			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary									DEFINE:MentalPotencyBonus|0	DESC:The mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment and illusion spell he casts increase by %1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by %1 (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be).|MentalPotencyBonus	BONUS:VAR|MentalPotencyBonus|min(MesmeristLVL/5,4)	SOURCEPAGE:p.43
Glib Lie				KEY:Mesmerist ~ Glib Lie				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural									DEFINE:GlibLieDC|0	DESC:A mesmerist can deceive truth-detecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of %1 to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn't detect the mesmerist's lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the glibness spell's bonus on Bluff checks.|GlibLieDC	BONUS:VAR|GlibLieDC|15+MesmeristLVL	SOURCEPAGE:p.43
Masterful Tricks			KEY:Mesmerist ~ Masterful Tricks			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural									DESC:A mesmerist can choose masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.	SOURCEPAGE:p.43
Rule Minds				KEY:Mesmerist ~ Rule Minds				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MesmeristClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural									DESC:A mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force the creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell's DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn't a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as dominate monster) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can't be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.	SOURCEPAGE:p.44
