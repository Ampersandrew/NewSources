Many of them manifest as dark and dreadful knights, their armor bristling with spikes and their hands seeming to grasp barbed and terrible weapons. Other times they appear as tall, gaunt f igures staring down arrogantly at those who approach. These phantoms typically spew a string of curses at their foes, often profane, sometimes poetic. Their auras are pulsating and pitch black, and thrum violently when these horrible phantoms attack.

Jealousy	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Emotional Focus.SpecialQuality	DESC:A phantom with this emotional focus is covetous of everything—its master, those who wish to do it harm, and any who do not pay attention to it. It demands to be the center of attention at all times. The forms these phantoms take are as diverse as the forms of jealousy in life. Often they take pleasing forms, wishing to draw others in. Other times they take the form of crawling and lurching things, grasping at all they covet when they come within reach. The auras of these needy phantoms quickly change in color, going from an oily green to orange, to brownish red as they swirl through emotions in their efforts to gain the objects of their dark desires.

Zeal	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Emotional Focus.SpecialQuality	DESC:A phantom with this emotional focus fixates on every task given as if it were the phantom’s last.

Zeal phantoms take the form of steadfast protectors or daring and manic creatures looking for the next challenge or opportunity to prove itself to either its master or itself. Often very prideful creatures, these phantoms display an orange aura upon completing their tasks. They are prone to boast about their accomplishments and chastise those around them for not accomplishing more.
