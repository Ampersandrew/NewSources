ANIMATE DEAD
Add your tier to your caster level when determining how many Hit Dice of undead you can animate with a single casting of this spell. This doesn’t increase the total number of Hit Dice worth of undead you can control. By expending a second use of mythic power, you can ignore the spell’s material component cost. Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, any skeletons or zombies you create gain either the agile (see page 224) or savage (see page 224) mythic template.

If you do, for a number of rounds equal to the spell’s level, half the cannon’s damage is untyped damage and the other half is energy damage of the spell’s type. Casting a spell with a different energy descriptor onto the cannon replaces its current energy type with that of the new spell.
BALEFUL POLYMORPH
The saving throw changes to Fortitude (partial) and Will (partial). A creature that fails the Fortitude save automatically fails the Will save.

For 1 minute per level, it takes on cosmetic features appropriate to that animal and becomes one size category closer to the animal’s size.

DISPEL MAGIC
When used as a targeted dispel, this spell can end two spellsaffecting the target instead of just one. If the targeted dispelsuccessfully dispels at least one spell, you heal 1d4 points ofdamage for every spell level of the dispelled spell. If you dispeltwo spells, this healing applies only to the highest-level spelldispelled. If you use this spell to counterspell, roll your dispelcheck twice and take the higher result.
DIVINE FAVOR
You also gain the luck bonus on saving throws and skill checks.Alternatively, you can cast this spell on another willing creature,changing the range to touch and target to living creature touched.
DIVINE PURSUIT
The speed of the movement form provided by the spell increasesby 30 feet. This adjustment is treated as an enhancementbonus. You gain a bonus on Perception and Survival skill checksattempted against the selected creature. This is a sacred bonusif you’re good or a profane bonus if you’re evil; if you’re neutral,choose either the sacred or profane bonus.
DOMINATE PERSON
The Sense Motive DC to notice your target is dominatedincreases by double your tier. You can give orders to the targeteven if it’s protected by non-mythic effects that block magicalcontrol, such as protection from evil. If the target is protected bya mythic effect, you can attempt to overcome this defense witha caster level check (DC 15 plus the caster level of the effect);add your tier to your roll and the opposing caster’s tier to theDC.

All uses fora particular casting have the same range, area, and energy type.You can have only one dragon’s breath spell in effect at a time;casting a new one ends the previous one.
DREAM
You or the messenger may gain information from the dreameryou contact by asking questions as if using speak with dead tospeak with a corpse. An unwilling dreamer can attempt to resistthis probing with a Will save (as speak with dead, using the DCdream would have if it allowed a saving throw). Answers tothese questions are still generally brief and cryptic.
DUST OF TWILIGHT
A creature that fails its Fortitude save against the spell mustalso succeed at a Will save at the same DC or fall asleep (as thesleep spell). Creatures that succeed at their saves are merelydrowsy (as the lullaby spell).Augmented: If you expend two uses of mythic power, add halfyour tier to the level of light spells mythic dust of twilight dispels.
EAR-PIERCING SCREAM

ELEMENTAL BODY (ALL)
Each mythic elemental body spell must be learned individually,and you must know the respective non-mythic elemental bodyspell to learn its mythic version. You don’t have to learn themin order, and aren’t required to know a lower-level mythicelemental body spell before you learn a higher-level one (forexample, you can learn mythic elemental body II if you knowelemental body II, even if you don’t know mythic elementalbody I). Each mythic elemental body spell adds the followingbenefits to its respective non-mythic version.The spell’s bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the naturalarmor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penaltiesdecrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0). There is a 50% chanceany critical hit or sneak attack against you is treated as a normalhit, as if you were wearing medium fortification armor.Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power,the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. You can also,a number of times equal to your tier, add half your tier to the DCof one spell you cast with an energy descriptor that matches yourelemental type (air: electricity, earth: acid, fire: fire, water: cold).
ENDURE ELEMENTS
The target changes to one creature touched per level. Affectedcreatures gain cold resistance 5 and fire resistance 5. They’renot slowed by snow, and ignore penalties on Perception checksand ranged weapon attacks from hail, rain, sleet, and snow.They treat wind as one category weaker.

When using the target as a weapon, add half yourtier to your attack roll, and add your tier to the damage roll.Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power,when you use the target to hit a creature, you can attempt a freebull rush combat maneuver against that creature. Your CMB forthis maneuver is equal to your attack bonus for mythic enemyhammer, except you add your tier instead of half your tier.

The number of negative levels inflicted increases to 1d6, andthe target is sickened for 24 hours. An undead creature struckby the ray gains 1d6 × 5 temporary hit points for a number ofhours equal to your caster level.Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power,any creature attempting to remove the target’s negative levelsmust succeed at a caster level check (DC 10 + your caster level+ your tier).
ENLARGE PERSON
You can increase the target’s size by up to two size categories,to a maximum of Huge. If the target grows two sizes, its weightincreases by a factor of 25, it gains a +4 size bonus to Strength,and takes a –4 size penalty to Dexterity and a –2 penalty onattack rolls and to AC because of its increased size. A Mediumhumanoid creature whose size increases to Huge has a spaceof 15 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. Mythic enlarge personcounters and dispels mythic reduce person.
ENTANGLE
The spell functions in areas without any vegetation, causingplants to spring up out of the ground. These plants can reachcreatures that are up to 10 feet in the air. Plants affectedor created by the spell sprout thorns that deal 1d6 points ofdamage each round to creatures in the area.
ENTROPIC SHIELD
When a ranged attack misses because of this spell, there is a50% chance that the attack is redirected back at the attackerrather than just being deflected harmlessly. The attack uses thesame result as the attack roll the attacker made against you.
EXPEDITIOUS RETREAT

This effect applies only tofigments with a caster level equal to or less than your tier.Augmented (2nd): If you expend two uses of mythic power,each creature in the burst must succeed at a Fortitude save orbe blinded for 1 round.
FALSE LIFE
The temporary hit points gained increase to 2d8 + 2 per casterlevel (maximum +20). As an immediate action, you can dismissthe remaining duration of the spell to prevent 1 point ofStrength, Dexterity, or Constitution damage per 10 temporaryhit points remaining from the spell. This takes effect after theattack hits you and the damage is rolled, but before you takethe damage. For example, if you have 22 temporary hit pointsfrom mythic false life and a wyvern stings you for 3 points ofConstitution damage, you can dismiss the spell to prevent 2points of Constitution damage from that attack.
FEAST OF ASHES
On a failed save, the target immediately takes 1d6 points
of nonlethal damage per tier. Add your tier to the DC of any
further Constitution checks the target attempts to resist the
effects of starvation as part of this spell’s effects. While the
curse is in effect, the target gains no benefit from any spell,
effect, or item that requires eating, such as the food from a
heroes’ feast spell (though the food is still used up when the
target eats it).
FEATHER FALL
The spell affects one additional target per level. The targets
don’t have to be within 20 feet of each other.
Augmented (4th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the spell absorbs the targets’ velocity and transforms it into a
concussive blast. Targets fall at the normal rate (not slowed)
but land safely. When a target lands, it creates a 10-foot-radius
burst of force that deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level
(maximum 5d6, Reflex half, DC equal to the DC of feather fall).
The targets of this spell are unaffected by these concussive blasts.
FINGER OF DEATH
The damage dealt increases to 15 points of damage per caster
level plus 1d8 points of Constitution damage. A creature that
succeeds at its saving throw takes 3d8 points of damage + 1
point per caster level, takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage,
and is staggered for 1 round.
FIRE SEEDS

caster level (maximum 20d6 for all acorns, no more than 10d6
for any particular acorn). Each holly berry’s damage increases
to 2d6 points of fire damage + 2 points per caster level. Any
creature that fails its Reflex save against an acorn or holly berry
catches on fire (Core Rulebook 444), taking 2d6 points of fire
damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Attempts to
extinguish this fire use the spell’s save DC.
FIRE SHIELD
The damage dealt to your attackers increases to 1d8 points of
damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). A chill shield
gives you fire immunity. A warm shield gives you cold immunity.
FIRE SNAKE

The damage dealt increases to 1d10 points of damage per level
(maximum 15d10). Any creature that fails its saving throw
against the spell is grappled by a snake made of fire that lasts
for 1 round per caster level. The snake can be dispelled, but not
attacked. A grappled creature takes 1d10 points of fire damage
on your turn each round. The snake’s CMB is equal to your caster
level plus your tier, and its CMD is equal to its CMB + 10.
Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the
maximum damage increases to 20d10, and any creature that fails
its saving throw against the spell is pinned instead of grappled.
FIRE STORM
The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of damage per caster
level (maximum 20d8). Half of this damage is fire damage, and
the other half is divine energy that bypasses fire resistance and
fire immunity. You can exclude any number of animals from
damage just as you can plant creatures.
Augmented (8th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
choose one creature type (and subtype, if humanoid or outsider)
to exclude from the effects of the spell. For each additional use
of mythic power you expend when casting the spell, exclude
another creature type. For example, if you expend two uses of
mythic power and choose magical beasts, you can exclude from
damage any number of magical beasts in the spell’s area.
FIREBALL
The damage dealt increases to 1d10 points of fire damage per
caster level (maximum 10d10). Any creature that fails its Reflex
saving throw catches on fire (Core Rulebook 444), taking 2d6
points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished.
Attempts to extinguish this fire use the spell’s save DC.
Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,

to a 40-foot radius spread, and any fire damage dealt by the
spell bypasses fire resistance and fire immunity.
FIRESTREAM

The damage dealt increases to 2d10 points of fire damage.
Any creature that fails its saving throw also catches fire (Core
Rulebook 444). The continuous line of fire pushes against all
creatures, making them treat the spell’s area as difficult terrain.
Augmented (4th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
you create a second line of fire using your other hand. If you
overlap the lines, creatures in the overlap must attempt two
saving throws and take the lower result, but don’t take damage
from both lines. You may stop either line of fire as a free action
on your turn, but once you stop maintaining a line, you must
cast mythic firestream again to recreate it.
FLAME BLADE
The blade’s damage increases to 2d6 points of fire damage +
1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The blade threatens a
critical hit on a natural 18–20 as if it were an actual scimitar.

the blade threatens a critical hit on a natural 15–20, and
bypasses hardness, fire resistance, and fire immunity.
FLAME STRIKE
The damage dealt increases to 1d8 per caster level (maximum
15d8). The area increases to a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high
cylinder. You may have the divine half of the damage affect
only one specific creature type (as the bane weapon quality).
FLAMES OF THE FAITHFUL

The fire damage dealt by this spell bypasses fire resistance and
fire immunity. On a successful critical hit, the target catches on
fire (Core Rulebook 444).
FLESH TO STONE
A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is partially
petrified, becoming slowed (as the slow spell) for a number
of rounds equal to your tier. The creature can end this effect
early by spending a full-round action breaking away its own
petrified flesh, dealing 5d10 points of damage to itself. Any
effect that removes or reverses petrification negates this partial
petrification and the slow effect.
The spell can affect objects and undead, as long as the target
is primarily made of flesh or bone, such as a corpse or zombie.
The spell doesn’t affect the target’s gear. If cast on a creature with
equipment, the creature transforms into stone but its gear doesn’t.
Augmented (9th): If you expend two uses of mythic
power, any Large or smaller creature fully petrified by the
spell immediately animates and follows your commands, as if
you had cast animate objects.
FLOATING DISK
The disk created by this spell lasts for 2 hours per caster level
and can carry up to 200 pounds of weight per caster level.
The disk accompanies you regardless of your speed, always
catching up no matter how far you move. If you stand or sit on
the disk, as a move action you can direct it to travel up to 30
feet in any direction.
Any objects resting on the disk count as weightless parts
of your gear for the purpose of teleportation effects (allowing
these items to go with you when you teleport despite the
weight limit of the teleportation spell).
As a free action, you can transform the plane of force from
a concave disk into a bucket-like shape that holds up to 4
gallons (or transform it from the bucket-like form back to its
normal disk form).
FLY
The fly speed changes to 120 feet (or 80 feet if the target is
wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or
heavy load) with perfect maneuverability. When the duration
expires, the target is protected by feather fall for a number of
rounds equal to your caster level.
Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic
power, the target adds your tier on Reflex saves and as a
dodge bonus to AC. It gains these bonuses only while flying.
FOG CLOUD
The radius of the fog increases to 50 feet.
Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the fog’s radius changes to 500 feet, and its height changes to
100 feet. Winds can’t dissipate the fog unless the area of the
wind affects the entire area of the augmented mythic fog cloud.
If you’re at least 6th tier and instead expend three uses of
mythic power, the range increases to 1 mile, the fog’s radius
changes to 1 mile, and its height changes to 500 feet. The
cloud is as resistant to wind as the 3rd-tier augmented version.
FORCE PUNCH

The damage dealt increases to 1d6 points of force damage
per caster level (maximum 10d6). If moving the target would
push it into another creature’s space and it has at least 10 feet
of distance remaining, you can attempt to overrun the other
creature, adding your tier on the combat maneuver check. For
each creature you overrun with the target, reduce the distance
the target moves by 5 feet. If moving the target would push it
into a solid obstacle (such as a wall or tree), the target takes
damage as if it had fallen the distance pushed.
Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
you can cast this spell as a ranged touch attack with a range
of close (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels), and the target
is treated as two size categories smaller for the purpose of
determining the total distance pushed.
FORESIGHT
The spell’s insight bonus increases to +3. If you cast the spell on
another creature, you and the target are simultaneously warned
by the spell, and the target gains the spell’s insight bonuses.
FORM OF THE DRAGON (ALL)
Each mythic form of the dragon spell must be learned
individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic
form of the dragon spell to learn its mythic version. You don’t
have to learn them in order, and aren’t required to know a
lower-level mythic form of the dragon spell before you learn
a higher-level one (for example, you can learn mythic form of
the dragon II if you know form of the dragon II, even if you
don’t know mythic form of the dragon I). Each mythic form of
the dragon spell adds the following benefits to its respective
non-mythic version.
The spell’s bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the
natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the breath weapon
damage increases to 10d6. All of the dragon form’s natural
attacks increase by one step (see Improved Natural Attack on
page 315 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary).
Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic
power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2.
During each casting of the spell, you can revert to your normal
form or back to your dragon form without ending the spell a
number of times equal to your tier.
GASEOUS FORM
The damage reduction changes to DR 10/epic and magic, and
the fly speed increases to 30 feet. The target can expand itself
as a free action, filling an area equal to double its normal space
and height (a Medium creature fills a 10-foot-by-10-foot space to
a height of about 10 feet) and blocking vision as obscuring mist.
Returning from expanded to normal size is also a free action.
Augmented: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the
target can shift into or out of gaseous form as a move action.
GIANT VERMIN
The vermin you transform with this spell gain DR 5/magic and
either the advanced creature template or the giant creature
template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 294, 295).
Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, any
vermin you transform also gains either the agile (see page 224) or
savage mythic template (see page 224) while the spell lasts.
If you’re at least 9th tier and expend three uses of mythic
power, the duration changes to instantaneous, meaning the
vermin retain their giant size. After a number of days equal to your
tier, you lose control over the vermin unless you have some other
way of controlling them, and they lose the agile or savage mythic
template but retain the advanced or giant creature template.
GLOBE OF INVULNERABILITY
Add half your tier to the level of non-mythic spells the globe
excludes. The globe excludes mythic spells of 4th level or lower.
GLYPH OF WARDING
Add your tier to the DC to detect or disable the glyph. Blast
glyph damage increases to 1d6 points of damage per caster
level (maximum 20d6). Add half your tier to the maximum spell
level you can store in a spell glyph.
GOODBERRY
Each berry provides a full day’s nourishment and counts as 1
hour of complete rest for the purpose of removing exhaustion,
fatigue, or nonlethal damage.
Augmented (2nd): You can cast the spell to affect only one
berry, imbuing into that berry any harmless druid spell you have
prepared. The spell remains stored in the berry for the duration
of the goodberry spell or until the berry is consumed. A creature
that eats the berry gains the benefits of that spell as if you had
cast it upon her. The maximum level of the imbued spell is equal
to half your tier, and you must expend one use of mythic power
for each spell level of the imbued spell (in addition to the one
use needed to cast mythic goodberry). Similar to imbue with
spell ability, you can’t prepare a spell in that spell’s slot until the
berry is consumed or the mythic goodberry spell ends.
GREASE
If you cast mythic grease on an area, add your tier to the
Acrobatics DC to move within or through the area. If you cast
it on a creature’s armor or clothing, add your tier to its Escape
Artist checks and combat maneuver checks attempted to
escape a grapple and to its CMD to avoid being grappled.
Augmented: You can expend two uses of mythic power to
make the grease flammable. It ignites from any fire at least the
size of a candle flame. If a greased area is ignited, any creature
in the area on your turn takes 1d3 points of fire damage and
might catch on fire (Core Rulebook 444). If a greased creature is
ignited, it takes 2d6 points of fire damage, and might catch on
fire; add your tier to the save DC.
GUARDS AND WARDS
You are alerted whenever any creature enters the warded area
as if by a mental alarm spell as long as you’re on the same plane
as the warded area. At will, you can concentrate to observe the
warded area as if using arcane eye. When you start concentrating,
the sensor always appears at a point you designate when you cast
the spell. You can place two of the five effects listed in the spell
(dancing lights and so on) instead of one.
Augmented (3rd): You can place the following effects
anywhere within the warded area by expending one additional
use of mythic power per effect.
6. Black tentacles in one place, returning after 10 minutes if
dispelled.
7. Dispel magic in one place. You select an area up to 5 feet
square, and any creature that enters or passes through the
area is targeted by the spell. Saving Throw: Will negates. Spell
Resistance: yes.
8. Entangle in four places, returning in 10 minutes if dispelled.
9. Explosive runes in three places, returning in 10 minutes if
activated or dispelled.
10. Slow in three places, returning in 10 minutes if dispelled.
GUST OF WIND
The force of the wind increases to windstorm (approximately 70
mph; Core Rulebook 439). All effects described in the spell affect
creatures one size larger. Ranged attacks can’t be attempted in
the area of the spell. The wind automatically blows
out unprotected flames and has a 75% chance of
blowing out protected flames.
Augmented (2nd): If you expend two uses
of mythic power, the spell lasts for 1 additional
round and the range increases by 30 feet. As
a swift action at the start of your turn, you can
expend another use of mythic power to extend the
duration by 1 round and the range by another 30 feet.
HARM
The damage dealt increases to 15 points of damage per caster
level (maximum 225 points).
Augmented: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the
spell also acts as poison.
HASTE
Affected creatures gain an additional move action each round. The
movement speed increase changes to 50 feet, to a maximum of
three times the creature’s normal speed for that movement type.
Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic
power, the movement speed increase changes to 70 feet,
with no limit based on the creature’s normal speed. If an
affected creature moves at least 30 feet on its turn, it can
travel across liquid as if the liquid were solid. If
the liquid deals damage on contact, the creature
takes only half damage from moving across it.
HEAL
The damage cured increases to 15 points of damage per caster
level (maximum 225 points).
Augmented: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the
spell also acts as restoration.
HEALING THIEF

Instead of stealing half the target’s healing, you steal all of it.
The amount of damage you steal before the spell is discharged
increases to 10 points per caster level (maximum 100 points).
Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the range of the spell changes to close (25 feet + 5 feet per 2
caster levels). If the target has fast healing or regeneration, you
steal half of its fast healing or regeneration. Healing from these
abilities count toward the maximum healing stolen before the
spell is discharged.
HEAT METAL
The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of fire damage on rounds
2 and 6 and to 2d8 points of fire damage per round on
rounds 3 through 5. On any round in which a creature
takes fire damage from this spell, that creature must
succeed at a Reflex save or catch on
fire (Core Rulebook 444).
HEROISM
The morale bonus increases to +4 and applies on all checks,
attack rolls, saves, and weapon damage rolls. Allies adjacent to
the target gain a +4 morale bonus on saves against fear effects.
Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic
power, the target can attempt one additional attack per round
when taking a full attack action (as if using a haste spell). The
target can use this additional attack ability a number of times
equal to your tier.
HEX WARD

The target gains immunity to one witch hex (but not a major
hex or grand hex) of your choice.
Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
instead of granting immunity to one witch hex, you can grant
immunity to two hexes or one major hex.
If you’re at least 6th tier and expend three uses of mythic
power, you instead grant immunity to three hexes, two major
hexes, or one grand hex.
HIDEOUS LAUGHTER
A creature of a type different than your own doesn’t gain a
bonus on its saving throws against this spell. The affected
target laughs so hard it hurts, and takes 1d6 points of nonlethal
damage each round it spends laughing.
If the target fails its initial save, it must succeed at two
follow-up saving throws (each a full-round action that doesn’t
provoke attacks of opportunity) to end the spell. Succeeding
at only one save means the spell no longer deals damage, but
the target is still unable to take actions.
Augmented: If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the target’s laughter becomes contagious. When the target’s
allies are within 30 feet and can hear the laugh, they must
successfully save against the spell or be sickened until the
target stops laughing. The sickened effect ends if the ally
moves more than 30 feet from the target or is unable to hear
the target’s laughter for an entire round.
HOLD PORTAL
The target portal can be as large as 30 square feet per caster
level. A creature attempting to force open the portal must first
succeed at a Will save against the spell’s DC. This is a mindaffecting
effect. Failure means the creature can’t open the door
while the spell is in effect.
HOLY SMITE
The damage dealt to evil outsiders increases to 1d10 points of
damage per caster level (maximum 10d10) and the damage
dealt to other evil creatures increases to 1d12 points of
damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d12). The duration that
creatures in the area are blinded increases to 2 rounds. On a
successful save, an evil creature is blinded for 1 round.
HOLY WORD
When determining the spell’s effect on non-mythic creatures,
add your tier to your caster level. Nongood creatures that fail
their saves also take a –4 penalty on attack rolls and saving
throws, and their spell resistance decreases by 5 for as long as
the spell’s other effects last.
HYDRAULIC PUSH

The water is boiling hot or freezing cold, dealing 1d6 points of
fire or cold damage per 2 caster levels. Add your tier to your
CMB for the spell.
HYDRAULIC TORRENT

The water is boiling hot or freezing cold, dealing 1d6 points
of fire or cold damage per 2 caster levels. Add your tier to
your CMB for the spell and on the Strength check to destroy
immovable targets.
Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the spell can extinguish magical fires as if using a targeted
dispel magic. Freezing cold water hardens into ice on the ground
(Core Rulebook 442), lasting as long as prevailing conditions
allow. Boiling hot water turns into steam, creating an area of
concealing mist (equivalent to obscuring mist) that fills the
affected squares and all squares adjacent to the line of the spell.
ICE STORM
The bludgeoning damage increases to 4d8 points of damage
and the cold damage increases to 3d6 points of damage. The
ground in the area is covered in ice and hailstones, acting as
though a grease spell were cast on it. Dealing 5 or more points
of fire damage to a square melts the ice and hail, negating the
grease effect.
Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
one creature in the area is paralyzed (as if by hold person) and
gains vulnerability to fire as long as it’s paralyzed.
ILL OMEN

For the target’s unlucky d20 rolls, it must roll three times and
take the lowest result. Spending a move action to utter a prayer
or good luck charm allows the target to roll twice instead of
three times.
Augmented (4th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
you afflict the target with especially foul luck. Any natural 20 it
rolls counts as a natural 1 instead.
INFLICT CRITICAL WOUNDS
The damage dealt increases to 8d8 points of damage + 2
points per caster level (maximum +40). A living target is
sickened for 1 round per caster level (maximum 20 rounds) if
it fails its saving throw.
INFLICT LIGHT WOUNDS
The damage dealt increases to 2d8 points of damage + 2 points per
caster level (maximum +10). A living target is sickened for 1 round
per caster level (maximum 5 rounds) if it fails its saving throw.
INFLICT MODERATE WOUNDS
The damage dealt increases to 4d8 points of damage + 2
points per caster level (maximum +20). A living target is
sickened for 1 round per caster level (maximum 10 rounds) if
it fails its saving throw.
INFLICT SERIOUS WOUNDS
The damage dealt increases to 6d8 points of damage + 2
points per caster level (maximum +30). A living target is
sickened for 1 round per caster level (maximum 15 rounds) if
it fails its saving throw.
INVISIBILITY
The invisible target can’t be detected with detect magic or
other spells that detect magic auras. The invisibility can’t
be penetrated, revealed, or dispelled by spells of 2nd level
or lower (such as see invisibility or glitterdust), though
true seeing and dust of appearance can reveal the invisible
target’s presence.
Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the invisible target is undetectable by blindsense, blindsight,
scent, and tremorsense.
IRRESISTIBLE DANCE
When casting the spell, you can choose to make the dance
either an unending dance or a dance of death.
A target affected by unending dance receives a new saving
throw at the end of each round of dancing, even if its initial
save was successful. If the save fails, the duration of the spell
increases by 1 round.
A target affected by the dance of death suffers excruciating
pain that inflicts a –4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and
skill checks, and it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each
round it spends dancing.
With either form, you can direct the creature like a marionette
as a move action, causing it to take a single move action at half
its speed along the path you specify. You must have line of sight
to the target and be within Medium range (100 feet + 10 feet
per caster level) to command its movement. This movement
provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, and doesn’t count
against the target’s movement on its turn. You can’t move a
target that succeeded at its initial save against the spell.
JITTERBUGS

Starting on the second round of the spell, the affected target
must succeed at a Fortitude save on your turn or be nauseated
for 1 round, as if distracted by an actual swarm.
KNOCK
The spell unlocks up to three means of closure instead of
two. The spell automatically opens locks of simple or average
quality, without requiring a caster level check to do so). If
used on a door locked with arcane lock, you can attempt a
free dispel check against it as if using a targeted dispel magic,
adding your tier to the check.
Augmented (3rd): You can expend two uses of mythic
power to target one locked item per tier, unlocking up to four
means of closure on each, allowing a free dispel against an
arcane lock on each, and automatically opening locks of up to
good quality (no caster level check needed).
If the door has a trap that triggers when opened, you
become aware of the trap and its general nature, and the
door is unlocked but doesn’t automatically open.
The spell can raise a barred gate, portcullis, or similar
impediment, but each one counts as two locked doors.
KNOW THE ENEMY

The insight bonus increases to +15 plus your tier. If the check is
successful, you gain a +5 insight bonus on your next attack roll
or saving throw against a creature of that type, as long as the
roll occurs within 24 hours of casting the spell.
LEVITATE
Instead of affecting one creature, you can affect a number of
targets up to your caster level, but the total weight supported
can be no more than 100 pounds per caster level. You can spend
a move action to mentally direct all targets, but you must move
all of them identically.
Augmented (8th): If you expend 10 uses of mythic power,
you permanently levitate a 5-foot cube of rock, which you can
move 20 feet vertically or horizontally as a move action.
If you have created multiple cubes and they are physically
touching each other, you can direct them all as a single move
action (as if they were one object), even if some of them are
out of range. Each levitating cube can support approximately
1,000 pounds of weight, allowing you to use it as a portion
of the foundation for a bridge, floating castle, or similar
construction project.
LIGHTNING ARC

The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of electricity damage
per caster level (maximum 15d8). A target that fails its save is
blinded by the flash for 1 round and deafened by thunder for
1d4 rounds.
Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic
power, the two targets can be up to 120 feet apart, the
lightning can turn once up to 90 degrees to connect the
targets, and the spell’s electrical damage bypasses electricity
resistance and electricity immunity.
LIGHTNING BOLT
The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of electricity damage
per caster level (maximum 10d8). Any creature that fails its
save is staggered for 1 round.
Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
you can bend the line of the spell once up to 90 degrees. Any
creature that fails its save is stunned for 1 round.
LIMITED WISH
When using mythic limited wish to duplicate another spell, you
can duplicate a mythic spell you know (if you’re a spontaneous
caster) or have prepared (if you’re a caster who prepares spells).
If you don’t know or haven’t prepared the mythic spell, you
can expend a second use of mythic power duplicate the mythic
version of the desired spell.
Augmented: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you
can cast a silent, stilled mythic limited wish, even if you’re
helpless or couldn’t otherwise take actions (but not unconscious).
MAGE ARMOR
The armor bonus increases to +6. There is a 50% chance that
any critical hit or sneak attack made against the target is
negated and treated as a normal hit, as if the target were
wearing moderate fortification armor.
MAGE’S DISJUNCTION
The duration increases to 10 minutes per caster level. The chance
to destroy an antimagic field increases to 2% per caster level.
MAGIC FANG
The spell affects an additional number of the target’s natural
weapons equal to your tier. For example, if you’re 3rd tier, it
could affect two claws and one bite).
MAGIC FANG, GREATER
This functions like mythic magic fang. You can add one of the
following weapon special abilities to natural attacks or unarmed
strikes affected by the spell: flaming, frost, keen, merciful, shock,
or thundering. You must choose only one with each casting of
the spell. For example, you can’t add flaming to a tiger’s bite
and keen to its claws with the same casting. If the target has an
Intelligence score less than 3, these abilities are always on (the
target can’t activate or deactivate the effect) and it might react
with fear if its attacks make noise or create visible energy.
Augmented (5th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
you can reduce the granted enhancement bonuses by 1 to
add two of the above abilities or one of the following abilities:
flaming burst, icy burst, or shocking burst.
MAGIC MISSILE
The damage dealt by each missile increases to 2d4+1. The
missiles bypass the shield spell and similar effects that block
the non-mythic version of this spell.
Augmented (4th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the spell creates double the normal number of missiles (affecting
up to 10 creatures), its range increases to line of sight, and it
bypasses the targets’ spell resistance and spell immunity.
MAGIC VESTMENT
You can add one armor special ability to the target if it’s
armor or one shield special ability if it’s a shield. The special
ability must have a base price modifier no greater than a +1
enhancement bonus or 4,000 gp.
Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic
power, you can add any number of special abilities with a
total base price modifier no greater than a +2 enhancement
bonus or 15,000 gp.
MAGIC WEAPON, GREATER
You can add one of the following weapon special abilities to the
weapon: flaming, frost, keen, merciful, shock, or thundering.
Augmented (5th): If you expend two uses of mythic
power, you can reduce the granted enhancement bonus by
1 to add two of the above abilities or one of the following
abilities: anarchic, axiomatic, flaming burst, holy, icy burst,
shocking burst, or unholy.
MAKE WHOLE
The damage the spell repairs increases to 2d6 points of damage
per caster level when cast on a construct creature (maximum
10d6). A construct repaired with this spell gains a +2 enhancement
bonus on an ability score of your choice for the next 24 hours.
To repair a magic item, your caster level has to equal to only the
caster level of the magic item, not double the caster level.
MAZE
A spectral minotaur hunts the target trapped in the maze. Every
round the creature fails to escape from the maze, it takes 2d8
+ your tier points of piercing and slashing damage from this
phantom opponent.
MEMORY LAPSE

The target forgets an additional round, back to the beginning of
the turn before its last turn.
Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
you can spend 1 round implanting a false memory in the
affected target. This false memory is limited to events that could
have occurred during the time it just forgot, as if using modify
memory but limited to that short period of time. For example,
you couldn’t implant the memory of a lengthy conversation, as
that couldn’t happen in the forgotten length of time.
The target can attempt a Will saving throw (DC equal to the
mythic memory lapse DC plus your tier) to resist this implanted
memory. Success means no memory is implanted, but the
target still forgets the allotted time.
METEOR SWARM
The meteors created by this spell deal bludgeoning damage
in a line extending from you to the target destination where it
explodes. Creatures in the path of a meteor take 2d10 points
of bludgeoning damage and must succeed at a Fortitude save
or be knocked prone. The damage from the exploding meteors
increases to 6d10 points of fire damage. Creatures that fail their
Reflex saves against the fire damage are also knocked prone
and deafened for 1d4 rounds.
Augmented (10th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
creatures in the path of a meteor also take 4d10 points of fire
damage and the damage from the exploding meteors increases
to 10d10 points of fire damage; this fire damage bypasses fire
resistance and fire immunity.
MIGHTY FIST OF THE EARTH

Add your tier to the rock’s attack roll and damage roll. Increase
the critical multiplier of the attack by 1 (maximum ×4).
MIRROR IMAGE
The maximum number of images generated by this spell
increases to 12. Destroying an image creates a flash of light. Any
creature that destroys an image must succeed at a Will save or
be dazzled for 1 round.
MISLEAD
You create one illusory double per 5 caster levels, each of
which appears in your square or in an unoccupied square
adjacent to yours. When you cast the spell, you can give each
of these doubles a simple programmed task as a telepathic
command, such a “walk south,” “beg for mercy,” or “follow
that troll.”
You can change or modify a single illusory double’s
programmed task by spending a swift, move, or standard
action; this requires concentration.
Augmented (4th): If you expend two uses of mythic
power, this spell also grants you the benefits of augmented
mythic invisibility instead of greater invisibility.
MODIFY MEMORY
You can modify an additional 5 minutes of the subject’s memory
per tier. You may affect multiple memories with one casting of
the spell, as long as the total number of minutes doesn’t exceed
this limit. Each affected memory counts as a minimum of 5
minutes. For example, you could implant a memory of having
a brief meeting with the mayor before lunch and another brief
meeting just after dinner, even though the two events would
have been hours apart.
Augmented (8th): If you expend four uses of mythic power,
instead of altering the target’s memories, you alter all other
creatures’ memories of the target (only the target gets a saving
throw against the spell). All creatures on the same plane as the
target forget his name, their relationship to him, and everything
he has done; he is essentially a stranger to them. Any important
acts by the target are attributed to someone else. Everyone’s
memories of history are rewritten to incorporate this change.
The target’s memories are unaffected. You can exclude a
number of other creatures up to your tier from the effects of
this spell (so they remember the truth), including yourself if
you wish. Written records are unchanged unless you expend an
additional six uses of mythic power when you cast the spell, and
written records on other planes remain unchanged regardless.
MONSTROUS PHYSIQUE (ALL)

Each mythic monstrous physique spell must be learned
individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic
monstrous physique spell to learn its mythic version. You
don’t have to learn them in order, and aren’t required to know
a lower-level mythic monstrous physique spell before you
learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn mythic
monstrous physique II if you know monstrous physique II, even
if you don’t know mythic monstrous physique I). Each mythic
monstrous physique spell adds the following benefits to its
respective non-mythic version.
The spell’s bonuses to ability scores increase by 2 each,
the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability
score penalties decrease by 2 each (minimum penalty of 0).
Alternatively, you can cast this spell on another willing creature,
changing the range to touch and the target to one creature.
Augmented (4th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. Additionally,
you can cast this spell on other willing creatures, changing the
range to touch and the target to one creature per tier.
MOVE EARTH
This spell can move earth much more quickly, with each full
round of casting allowing you to reshape a 25-foot-square area
up to 10 feet deep. All creatures on or under the ground within
that area are knocked prone and moved to the closest square
outside the area being shaped. A successful Reflex save prevents
a creature from being knocked prone, but it’s still moved.
MURDEROUS COMMAND

This spell lasts for a number of rounds equal to your tier. Each
round after the first, the target can attempt a new saving throw
at the beginning of its turn to break free of the spell.
Augmented: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the
target attacks its nearest ally with its most powerful spell, spell-like
ability, or supernatural ability. If it has no such ability, it attacks the
ally with a melee weapon or natural weapon as normal and gains
a +4 morale bonus on the attack and damage rolls.
NAMED BULLET

Increase the critical multiplier of the target weapon by 1
(maximum ×4).
Augmented (2nd): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the target ammunition or weapon returns to the creature that
shot or threw it just before that creature’s next turn (similar to
a returning weapon). The spell isn’t discharged until the target
is used to attempt a second attack against the named creature.
Ammunition that hits is destroyed and doesn’t return.
NIGHTMARE
The spell’s damage increases to 4d6 points of damage, and the
target is also shaken for 24 hours.
Augmented (6th): You can deliver a mind-affecting spell
through a mythic nightmare. The maximum level of the delivered
spell is equal to half your tier, and you must expend one use of
mythic power for each spell level of the imbued spell in addition
to the one use needed to cast mythic nightmare. You choose
whether the delivered spell affects the creature immediately or
when it awakens. The delivered spell affects only the target, even
if it normally affects multiple creatures or an area.
OATH OF PEACE

You don’t provoke attacks of opportunity when you attempt
Heal checks, cast targeted spells with the harmless descriptor,
or use positive energy effects to heal living creatures.
OBSCURING MIST
The range increases to 50 feet, and the cloud’s radius and
height both increase to 50 feet.
Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the range increases to 500 feet. The cloud’s radius increases
to 500 feet, and its height increases to 100 feet. Winds can’t
dissipate the mist unless the area of the wind affects the entire
area of this spell. Areas of mist burned away by fire spells
become obscured again 1d4 rounds after the fire effect ends.
If you’re at least 6th tier and expend three uses of mythic
power, the range increases to 1 mile, the cloud radius increases
to 1 mile, and its height increases to 500 feet. The cloud is as
resistant to wind and fire effects as the 3rd-tier version.
ORB OF THE VOID

A creature that fails its save against the orb gains 2 negative
levels rather than 1. A successful Fortitude save reduces this to 1
negative level.
Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the orb doesn’t automatically stop when in enters a space with
a living creature, but the saving throw DC decreases by 2 for
each creature after the first it affects each round.
An individual creature can be affected by the orb of the void
only once per round, even if the orb moves through its space
more than once.
ORDER’S WRATH
The damage dealt to chaotic outsiders increases to 1d10 points
of damage per caster level (maximum 10d10) and the damage
to other chaotic creatures increases to 1d12 points of damage
per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d12). The duration that creatures
in the area are dazed increases to 2 rounds. Chaotic creatures
that succeed at their saves are dazed for 1 round.
PERNICIOUS POISON

The number of successful saving throws needed to cure a poison
increases by one. If the poison deals ability damage on a failed
saving throw, that ability damage increases by 1.
Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the target’s penalty on saves against poison increases to –8,
and the penalty for attempting to cure the target with skill or
magic increases to –8.
If you expend three uses of mythic power, the poison
bypasses the creature’s poison immunity (this doesn’t affect
poison immunity from not having a Constitution score).
PHANTASMAL KILLER
If the target fails its Will save but succeeds at its Fortitude save,
the phantasmal killer persists in the target’s mind, giving it
the dazed condition until your next turn. On your next turn,
the target must attempt another Fortitude save against the
phantasm. Success means it takes 3d6 points of damage;
failure means it dies from fear.
Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the spell can affect a living target that is immune to fear,
illusions, or mind-affecting effects.
PHANTOM STEED
The steed’s rider automatically succeeds at Ride checks to
remain mounted. The mount’s hit points increase to 10 plus 2
per caster level, and its speed increases to 30 feet per 2 caster
levels (maximum 150 feet).
Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the phantom steed is incorporeal, but its rider can interact with
it normally.
PILLAR OF LIFE

The damage healed increases to 3d8 points of damage + 1 point per
caster level (maximum +20). The damage dealt to undead increases
to 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8), or 2d6
points of damage per caster level for undead vulnerable to bright
light (maximum 20d6). If a dead creature is brought into the pillar’s
square and that creature could be revived by breath of life, the pillar
of life ends and the creature returns to life as per breath of life.
PLANE SHIFT
If you’ve been to the destination plane and are familiar with a
location there, you may choose that location and arrive on target
at that location with anyone else you transport with the spell.
Augmented: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you
grant transported creatures the effects of a planar adaptation spell
(Advanced Player’s Guide 236) upon arrival, lasting for 1 hour.
POLAR RAY
The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of cold damage per
caster level (maximum 25d8) and 1d6 points of Dexterity drain.
If the target takes damage from this spell, it becomes partially
encased in ice, reducing its speed by half. Creatures with the
cold or incorporeal subtypes or immunity to being grappled
are immune to this effect. The reduced movement lasts until
the ice is destroyed. Destroying the ice requires a successful
Strength or dispel check against the spell’s DC or dealing 1 point
of bludgeoning or fire damage per caster level to the target.
POWER WORD BLIND
Treat the target’s current hit point total as though it were
lowered by 5 times your tier. For example, a 3rd-tier archmage
casting mythic power word blind would affect a creature with
60 hp as though it had 45 hp, and the spell would permanently
blind the target.
You can target a creature with more hit points than this spell
could normally affect, causing it to treat all opponents as though
they had concealment (20% miss chance) for 1d4 rounds.
Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic
power, the magic of the word lingers around the target. Until
the beginning of your next turn, if the target’s hit points are
reduced enough to put it in a lower category for the spell’s
effects, the spell affects the creature according to its new hit
point total. For example, a creature in the 101–200 hp category
reduced to 80 hp immediately becomes blinded for 1d4+1
minutes instead of 1d4+1 rounds. The spell’s effects don’t
diminish if the target regains hit points.
POWER WORD KILL
Treat the target’s current hit point total as though it were
lowered by 5 times your tier. For example, a 3rd-tier archmage
casting mythic power word kill would instantly kill a creature
with 85 hit points or fewer.
You can target a creature with more hit points than this spell
could normally affect, causing it to become exhausted.
Augmented (6th): If you expend four uses of mythic power, the
magic of the word lingers around the target. Until the beginning of
your next turn, if the target’s hit point total drops to the point that
this spell would have killed it upon casting, it’s instantly slain.
POWER WORD STUN
Treat the target’s current hit point total as though it were lowered
by 5 times your tier. For example, a 3rd-tier archmage casting this
spell would affect a creature with 60 hp as though it had 45 hp,
and the spell would last an additional 2d4 rounds.
You can target a creature with more hit points than this spell
could normally affect, causing it to become dazed for 1 round.
Augmented (6th): If you expend three uses of mythic power,
the magic of the word lingers around the target. Until the
beginning of your next turn, if the target’s hit points are reduced
enough to put it in a lower category for the spell’s effects, the
spell affects the creature according to its new hit point total. For
example, a creature in the 101–150 hp category reduced to 80 hp
is immediately stunned for an additional 1d4 rounds. The spell’s
effects don’t diminish if the target regains hit points.
POX PUSTULES

The Dexterity penalty increases to –6. The target takes 1 point
of bleed damage each round. If the target spends a move
action scratching, increase its bleed damage each round by 1. If
the bleeding is stopped, scratching causes it to start again at 1
point of bleed per round.
PRAYER
The spell’s luck bonus increases to +2, and the penalty for enemies
changes to –2. When you cast the spell, your affected allies heal an
amount of hit point damage equal to double your tier, and affected
enemies take an amount of damage equal to double your tier.
PRISMATIC SPHERE
When you cast the spell, you simultaneously create a prismatic
spray that originates from one point on the sphere and radiates
directly away from you. The save DC of this prismatic spray is
the same as that of your mythic prismatic sphere.
PRISMATIC SPRAY
The spell automatically blinds creatures with up to 12 Hit Dice
instead of 8 Hit Dice. Attempt one bull rush combat maneuver
and apply its results to each creature in the area. Your CMB for
this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence,
Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull
rush doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity.
Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the area changes from a cone into a line. Creatures in the line
are struck by two beams (or three, if the creature rolls an 8 on
the table). The spell bypasses energy resistance
and immunity.
PROTECTION FROM ARROWS
The damage reduction increases to 15/magic.
The maximum damage prevented by the
spell increases to 15 points per caster level (maximum 150
points). If the spell prevents all damage from a ranged
weapon attack, it turns the projectile or weapon back
on the attacker, using the same attack roll result. If the
attacker is also protected by mythic protection from
arrows and its spell completely prevents the damage
from the rebounded attack, the weapon or
projectile is destroyed.
PROTECTION FROM CHAOS
As mythic protection from evil,
except against chaotic creatures.
PROTECTION FROM EVIL
The bonuses to AC and on saves increase to +4. Any evil creature
attempting to possess or exercise mental control over the target
must attempt a Will save against this spell. If it fails, the creature
takes 1d6 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d6)
from mental feedback. An evil creature that uses spell resistance to
bypass the spell’s protection against contact must successfully save
or take this damage once each round it attacks the protected target.
PROTECTION FROM GOOD
As mythic protection from evil, except against good creatures.
PROTECTION FROM LAW
As mythic protection from evil, except against lawful creatures.
RAY OF ENFEEBLEMENT
The Strength penalty increases to 1d8 + 1 per 2 caster levels
(maximum +10). If the target fails its save, it’s fatigued.
REDUCE PERSON
You can decrease the target’s size by up to two categories, to
a minimum of Tiny. If the target shrinks two sizes, its weight
decreases by a factor of 16 and it gains a +4 size bonus to
Dexterity, a –4 size penalty to Strength, and a +2 bonus on attack
rolls and to AC because of its decreased size. A Medium or
Small humanoid creature whose size decreases to Tiny has a
space of 2-1/2 feet and a natural reach of 0 feet.
Mythic reduce person counters and dispels mythic
enlarge person.
REGENERATE
The casting
time changes to
1 standard action
and the target changes
to 1 living creature or
corpse touched. The spell
removes the blinded,
dazzled, and deafened
conditions. The target gains
regeneration equal to your tier
(overcome by acid and fire) for 1
round per caster level. If the target
was killed by amputation or decapitation (such
as from a vorpal weapon) within the past 1 round,
the spell regenerates lost body parts and brings
the creature back to life (as breath of life), treating it as if
it had negative hp equal to its Constitution score.
REPEL WOOD
The casting time changes to 1 immediate action.
You may cause one affected wooden object up to 5
inches in diameter to splinter and break.
Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the area changes to a 60-foot, cone-shaped emanation from you.
RESIST ENERGY
The target gains a +4 bonus on saves against effects that deal
damage of the selected energy type. Once each round as a free
action, the target can choose one adjacent ally to gain energy
resistance 5 against the chosen energy type for 1 round. This
increases to energy resistance 10 at caster level 7 and energy
resistance 15 at caster level 11.
RESONATING WORD

The damage dealt increases to 8d6 points on the 1st and 2nd
rounds and 15d6 on the 3rd round. The target takes a –4 penalty
on saving throws against all sonic effects.
REVERSE GRAVITY
Creatures in the area or that enter the area must succeed at a
Fortitude save or be nauseated.
Augmented (8th): If you expend three uses of mythic
power, once per round as a move action you may select
one secured creature (one that succeeded at its Reflex save)
or attached object (such as a tree or cottage) and force it
to attempt a Fortitude save against the spell. The selected
creature or object can weigh no more than 100 pounds per
caster level. If it fails the save, it’s pulled free and falls upward.
RICOCHET SHOT

If the attack hits the secondary target, the wielder can select
a tertiary target within 20 feet of the secondary target. This
functions like a ricochet off the primary target. The tertiary
target must be a different creature than the primary target.
Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the secondary and tertiary attacks gain the enhancement bonus
and magic qualities of the attack against the primary target.
SACRED BOND

The range at which you and the target can cast conjuration
(healing) spells on each other increases to medium (100 feet + 10
feet per caster level). When you or the target uses the sacred bond
to cast a healing spell on the other, the caster also heals a number
of hit points equal to the minimum amount the spell can heal.
Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
casting a healing spell through the link heals the caster the
normal amount instead of the minimum amount.
You and the target can use the link to heal each other with
targeted healing abilities such as lay on hands. Unlike with
healing spells, a character using a healing ability in this way
doesn’t heal herself.
SANCTIFY ARMOR

You gain DR 5/evil while wearing the target armor. While you’re
using your judgment or smite ability, this improves to DR 10/evil.
Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
when you use judgment or smite, add half your tier to your AC
as a sacred bonus.
SANCTUARY
If an attacker succeeds at its Will save to attack the protected
target, add your tier to the target’s AC against the attack. If the
target uses a healing spell or ability on another creature, that
creature gains the benefit of non-mythic sanctuary for 1 round.
If the creature breaks the non-mythic sanctuary by attacking,
subsequent healing by the target doesn’t create another nonmythic
sanctuary effect on the creature.
Augmented (2nd): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
select a number of additional creatures equal to half your tier
that are within reach. These creatures gain the benefit of nonmythic
sanctuary.
SANDS OF TIME

You age the target by two categories instead of one. The
damage dealt to objects, constructs, and undead increases to
5d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20).
Augmented (8th): If you expend four uses of mythic
power, the duration changes to instantaneous. If the target
is a living creature, its age increases to venerable, regardless
of its current age. A non-mythic creature receives no saving
throw against this, but a mythic creature can attempt a
Fortitude save against the spell’s DC to reduce the duration
to 10 minutes per level and the effect to two age categories
instead of automatically changing to venerable.
If the target is an object, construct, or undead, it takes
30 points of damage per caster level. A mythic creature that
succeeds at a Fortitude takes only half damage.
SAVING FINALE

Add your tier as a bonus on the saving throw reroll.
SCORCHING ASH FORM

The damage dealt increases to 3d6 points of fire damage. This
otherwise makes the same changes as mythic gaseous form.
Augmented: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the
target can shift into or out of scorching ash form as a move action.
SCORCHING RAY
Each ray’s damage increases to 6d6 points of fire damage. The
first ray bypasses fire resistance and immunity.
SCOURING WINDS

The spell’s damage increases to 4d8 points of piercing damage.
Any creature in the area at the start of your turn must succeed
at a Reflex save or be blinded for as long as it remains in the
area and for 1d4 rounds after it leaves.
Augmented (5th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the sandstorm’s radius and height each increase to 40 feet, and
the damage dealt increases to 6d8 points of piercing damage.
Each round, you can either move the storm up to 50 feet as a
move action or up to 10 feet as a swift action.
SEARING LIGHT
The spell’s damage increases to 1d6 per caster level
(maximum 10d6). The damage dealt to an undead creature
increases to 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum
10d8), or 2d6 per caster level (maximum 20d6) if the undead
is vulnerable to bright light. The damage dealt to constructs
increases to 1d8 points of damage per 2 caster levels
(maximum 5d8). If a creature struck has light sensitivity or
light blindness, it takes the penalty from that weakness for 1
round after being struck by the light.
SENDING
You can contact a number of additional creatures equal to your
tier. Each creature must receive the same message, and can
communicate back only to you.
Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
you can send the message to unfamiliar creatures (using the
same number of creatures as non-augmented mythic sending).
You must either describe the intended recipients in general or
specific terms (such as “orcs,” “the queen of this country,” or
“left-handed half-elven males”) or specify restrictions such as
range, creature type, and alignment (such as “all good-aligned
humanoids in the castle on the hill”). If a greater number of
creatures meet your description than the maximum number
you can send to, the closest ones to you receive the message.
SHADOW ANCHOR

Add your tier to the CMD of the shadow tether. A creature
attempting to escape the shadow tether using planar travel or
teleportation must succeed at a Will saving throw or be shunted
to the Plane of Shadow instead of its intended destination, as
if it had cast shadow walk (if the target could not reach the
Shadow Plane from its current location using shadow walk, this
aspect of the spell has no effect).
SHADOW WEAPON

Add your tier to your caster level when determining what
enhancement bonus or weapon special abilities the weapon
can have. The weapon deals half damage to creatures that
disbelieve in it and to objects, instead of only 1 point.
You can spend a swift action to transform the weapon into a
dull black metal ring on your finger, or to return it from its ring
form to its weapon form in your hand.
SHATTER
Add your tier to your caster level when determining the
maximum object weight you can affect. When targeting a
crystalline creature, the spell’s damage increases to 1d8 points
of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). You may
damage a single magical object as if it were a crystalline
creature. If the spell destroys an object or damages a crystalline
creature, broken shards litter the spell area or creature’s space
and act as caltrops.
SHIELD OF FAITH
Add half your tier to the spell’s deflection
bonus.
SHIELD OTHER
Increase the range to long
(400 feet + 40 feet per
caster level). Subtract
your tier from any
damage transmitted
to you through
the mystical
connection before
applying the
damage (minimum
1 hp of damage).
When you use your
surge ability to modify a saving throw against an effect that
also affects your linked ally, the ally also applies your surge
bonus die result to the ally’s saving throw. If the ally also
uses its own surge ability, it takes either your result or its
result, whichever is higher.
SHOCKING GRASP
The spell’s damage increases to 1d8 points
of electricity damage per caster level
(maximum 5d8). If the target is
wearing metal armor or is made of
metal, you may attempt a free grapple
combat maneuver against the target.
Alternatively, if the target is carrying a
metal weapon, you may attempt a free disarm
combat maneuver against that weapon. This free combat
maneuver doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity.
Augmented: If you expend two uses of mythic power
and the free grapple or disarm combat maneuver
is successful, the target is staggered until your
next turn. This is an electricity effect.
SHOUT
The duration that creatures in the area
are deafened increases to 4d6 rounds,
and the damage dealt increases to
5d8 points of sonic damage. The
damage dealt to crystalline creatures
and exposed brittle or crystalline objects
increases to 1d8 points of sonic damage per caster level
(maximum 15d8). Crystalline creatures reverberate with sonic
energy, taking 4 points of sonic damage on your turn for a
number of rounds equal to your tier.
SILENCE
This spell also applies to telepathy, cutting off any mental
communication within the area. At the time of casting, you can
choose to be immune to your own mythic silence effect and
can designate up to one creature per tier to
also gain this immunity. Creatures immune
to the mythic silence are subject to sonic
effects as normal.
SILENT IMAGE
The duration
increases to
concentration + 1
round per caster level,
and the effect increases to a visual figment
that can’t extend beyond eight 10-foot cubes +
1 10-foot cube per caster level.
Augmented (6th): If you expend
two uses of mythic power, the duration
changes to concentration + 1 minute per
caster level and the effect changes to a
visual figment no larger than a 50-foot
emanation. An augmented mythic silent
image can’t move.
SLEEP
The spell affects up to 8 Hit Dice of
creatures, and you can choose the
order in which creatures are affected
by the spell. Any effect that would
automatically awaken a sleeping
creature instead allows it to
attempt a new Will saving throw
to awaken.
Augmented (8th): If you
expend three uses of mythic
power, you can target all
living creatures other than
you that have 8 Hit Dice
or fewer in a 1-mile
radius centered on
you. Creatures that fail
their saving throws fall
asleep for a number of
days equal to your tier.
You can select a number
of creatures up to your tier to not be
affected by the spell.
SLOW
The penalty on attack rolls, on Reflex saves, and to AC increases
to –2, and affected creatures move at one-fourth speed. Select
one affected creature; this creature is denied its Dexterity
bonus to AC.
SOLID FOG
The penalty on melee attack and damage rolls increases to –4.
The cloud’s radius and height both increase to 50 feet.
Augmented: The augmented version of mythic solid fog
has the same additional benefits as the augmented version of
mythic fog cloud.
SPIDER CLIMB
The target gains a climb speed equal to its base land speed
or 30 feet, whichever is higher. The target can take the run
action while climbing and needs only one hand free to climb.
The target can move freely across spider webs (including
giant spider webs), web spells, and similar adhesives of 2nd
level or less (including tanglefoot bags) as if it were using
freedom of movement.
SPIKE STONES
The damage dealt increases to 2d6 points of piercing damage
plus 1 point of bleed damage. Add your tier to the DC to detect
the magical trap.
SPIRITUAL WEAPON
The weapon gains your choice of one of the following magic
weapon special abilities: flaming, frost, keen, merciful, shock,
or thundering. Before or after the weapon attempts all of its
attacks for the round, you can redirect it to a different target as
a swift action instead of a move action.
STINKING CLOUD
Creatures that succeed at their saves are sickened while they
remain in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after they leave.
Creatures that fail their saves continue to be sickened for 1 hour
after leaving the cloud.
STONE SHAPE
The duration changes to 1 round/level and instantaneous
(see text). Each round after the round you cast the spell, you
can spend a standard action to shape up to 5 additional cubic
feet of stone you touch. Shaped stone has an instantaneous
duration (meaning it does not revert to its previous form when
the spell ends).
STONESKIN
The target gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against disease,
poison, and stun effects. There is a 50% chance any critical hit
or sneak attack against the target is treated as a normal hit, as
if the target were wearing medium fortification armor.
STORM OF VENGEANCE
The acid damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of acid damage.
The lightning damage dealt increases to 10d8 points of
electricity damage. You can call down a bolt of lightning on the
2nd and 4th rounds (equivalent to those on the 3rd round). You
can strike the same target with a bolt more than once during
the casting of the spell, but not more than once per round.
Augmented (7th): If you expend three uses of mythic power,
the storm cloud’s radius increases to 1,000 feet. Structures in
the storm take 1d10 points of damage per round (this damage
bypasses hardness). You can call down one additional bolt in the
2nd and 4th rounds, and three additional bolts in the 3rd round.
STRANGLING HAIR

You may use your hair to attempt dirty trick, disarm, steal, or trip
combat maneuvers instead of grapple combat maneuvers. Add
your tier to combat maneuver checks attempted with your hair
and to your hair’s damage rolls made as part of a grapple.
SUGGESTION
Mythic suggestion loses the language-dependent descriptor, and
can target one or more living creatures in a 10-foot-radius burst.
SUMMON SWARM
The swarm has the advanced simple template. A swarm of
rats or spiders leaves behind a trail of filth or ichor when it
moves, which has the effects of a grease spell for 1 round after
the swarm passes through an area. Any creature that moves
through the affected area is also subject to the swarm’s disease
or poison, as if attacked by the swarm. A prone creature in the
affected area takes a –4 penalty on its saving throw against this
affliction. A bat swarm leaves behind a similar trail that lasts for
2 rounds but doesn’t have a disease or poison effect.
SUN METAL

The additional damage dealt by the weapon increases to 1d6 points
of fire damage. Any creature struck by the weapon is dazzled for
1 round (no saving throw). On a critical hit, the target is blinded
for 1 round (Fortitude negates, DC equal to the DC of the spell).
SUNBEAM
You call forth one beam per 2 caster levels instead of per 3. The
damage dealt increases to 4d8 points of damage. The damage dealt
to undead creatures, fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes increases to 1d8
points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d8). Any creature
that successfully saves against a beam is dazzled for 1 minute.
Augmented (9th): If you expend three uses of mythic power,
the first beam you create has a duration of 1 round per 2 caster
levels, and deals maximum damage on the round you cast
it. Creatures in the beam can attempt saving throws to avoid
blindness, but not the spell’s damage.
SURMOUNT AFFLICTION

You can cast this spell with no verbal or somatic component,
and even if you’re helpless (but not unconscious). You
temporarily overcome a number of additional harmful
conditions equal to half your tier.
Augmented (7th): If you expend three uses of mythic
power, you become immune to all afflictions the spell can
normally overcome. In addition, you overcome (but do not
become immune to) one of the following conditions: exhausted,
nauseated, panicked, petrified, staggered, and stunned.
TELEKINESIS
The duration of this spell changes to 1 round per level. You
may spend a move action to use the sustained force or combat
maneuver effects of the spell.
When using sustained force, you can move a number of
objects up to your tier. These must be in the same square and
together must weigh no more than the weight limit of the spell.
Using the violent thrust effect ends the spell, but the weight
restriction increases to 50 pounds per caster level (maximum
750 pounds).
THEFT WARD

Add your tier to the Perception check bonus. Add your tier
to your CMD against disarm and steal combat maneuvers
attempted against the item.
TIME STOP
Select a number of creatures equal to half your tier or fewer
within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels).
Mythic time stop has the same effect on these creatures as
it does on you, allowing them to act for the same number of
rounds of apparent time that you can. You and these creatures
can all interact with one another normally while time appears
to be stopped.
Augmented (10th): If you expend three uses of mythic
power, the duration increases to 1 hour per level of apparent
time. You and other affected creatures gain no benefit from
rest or sleep while the spell is active.
TOUCH INJECTION

Add half your tier to the DC of a poison or potion you inject into
another creature with this spell. If you do this with a substance
that grants a skill bonus, add your tier to that skill bonus.
TRANSFORMATION
You can still cast spells and use spell completion and spell
trigger items, but the level of the spell you’re casting or using
must be equal to or less than your tier. You gain a number of
temporary hit points equal to your caster level.
TRUE FORM

The spell’s target changes to up to one creature per 2 caster
levels. If a target is a creature that has the ability to change
shape between a specific set of forms (such as a barghest or
lycanthrope), you may choose which form the creature takes.
To force such a creature into a form, you must have either seen
it in that form or succeeded at an appropriate Knowledge check
to know the creature has the ability to take that form.
Augmented (6th): If you expend three uses of mythic power,
the spell creates an area affecting all shapechanging creatures.
The range changes to 30 feet and the spell affects all creatures in
a 30-foot radius around you. Each creature must attempt a saving
throw against the spell every round it remains in the area.
TRUE STRIKE
The affected attack bypasses all damage reduction.
Augmented (2nd): If you expend two uses of mythic
power, you gain a +10 insight bonus on your second attack
that round and a +5 insight bonus on your third attack that
round. The second and third attacks can be on your turn or on
another creature’s turn before your next turn (such as when
you attempt an attack of opportunity).
TSUNAMI

The wave increases to 20 feet wide per caster level and 3 feet
tall per caster level. The damage dealt to those struck by the
wave increases to 12d6 points of bludgeoning damage. Add
your tier to the wave’s special combat maneuver check. The
damage dealt to those that fail to escape the wave increases
to 6d8 points of bludgeoning damage.
Augmented (5th): If you expend three uses of mythic
power, you create a truly monstrous wave. The wave increases
to 20 feet deep, 20 feet wide per caster level, and 5 feet tall
per caster level. The duration of the effect increases to 10
rounds, and the speed of the wave increases to 120 feet per
round on the surface of the water and 60 feet per round on
land or underwater.
UNHOLY BLIGHT
The damage dealt to good outsiders increases to 1d10 points
of damage per caster level (maximum 10d10) and the damage
dealt to other good creatures increases to 1d12 points of
damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d12). The duration that
creatures within the area are sickened increases to 2d4 rounds.
On a successful save, a good creature is slowed for 1 round.
UNSHAKABLE CHILL

On a failed save, the target immediately takes 1d6 points of
nonlethal cold damage per tier. Add your tier to the DC of any
other Fortitude saves the target attempts to resist severe cold as
part of the spell’s effects. The target also takes a –4 penalty on
saves against spells or effects with the cold descriptor.
Augmented (5th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the target gains vulnerability to fire (Bestiary 305).
VAMPIRIC TOUCH
The spell’s damage increases to 1d8 points of damage per
2 caster levels (maximum 10d8). Your melee touch attack
to deliver the spell threatens a critical hit on a 19 or 20. This
expanded threat range doesn’t stack with other effects or
abilities that increase the threat range. If the damage kills the
target, you gain fast healing 5 for a number of rounds equal to
the Hit Dice of the target.
VOMIT TWIN

Any spell you cast that has a range of touch, close, medium,
or long can originate from the twin instead
of you. The twin gains a deflection bonus
to AC equal to your tier, and
has hit points equal to double
your caster level. The twin can
attempt attacks of opportunity
using your base attack
bonus, but has no ability
score modifiers, skills, or
feats. It threatens an area
appropriate for your size
and wields a copy of the
weapon you were wielding
when you cast mythic
vomit twin. If the twin’s
weapon is destroyed
or disarmed, on your
turn the twin generates
a new weapon from
its own substance. Its
attacks deal damage using
that weapon’s die type.
Augmented (5th): If you
expend two uses of mythic
power, you create two copies
when you cast the spell, and
both can be active at the
same time. If you instead
expend three uses of mythic
power, you create three copies
when you cast the spell, and all
three can be active at the same time.
WALK THROUGH SPACE

You can teleport as either a move action or a
swift action, but never more than once per round. If you expend
a move action and a swift action, you may teleport up to 60 feet.
WALL OF FIRE
The wall’s damage increases to 2d6 points of fire damage to
creatures within 10 feet, 1d6 points of fire damage to those
past 10 feet but within 20 feet, and 2d8 points of fire damage
+ 1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any
creature passing through it. Any creature that passes through
the wall or is within 5 feet of the wall when it’s created must
succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire. Attempts to extinguish
this fire use the spell’s save DC.
Augmented (5th): If you expend two uses of mythic
power, you may move the wall 5 feet in any direction as a
move action on your turn. Moving the wall into a fireproof
barrier (such as a stone wall) destroys the part of the wall
that overlaps the barrier.
WALL OF FORCE
The wall’s hardness increases to
40, and its hit points increase to
30 per caster level. A nonmythic
disintegrate spell
or rod of cancellation
negates a 10-footsquare
section of a
mythic wall of force
for 1 round, after which the
wall reforms at full strength.
One side of the wall (chosen by
you) repels creatures within 5 feet as a
repulsion spell (using the DC wall of force
would have if it allowed a saving throw).
WALL OF ICE
The wall’s hit points increase to
5 hit points per inch of thickness.
Add your tier to the Strength check DC
to break through the wall. The damage dealt
to those that step through the wall increases
to 1d8 points of cold damage + 1 point per
caster level. Any creature that passes through
the wall must succeed at a Fortitude save or be
staggered for 1d4 rounds; this is a cold effect.
Augmented (5th): If you expend two uses of
mythic power, you cover the wall in sharp, protruding
icicles. Any creature that touches, strikes, or breaks
through the wall takes 1d6 points of cold damage, 1d6
points of piercing damage, and 1 point of bleed damage.
WALL OF IRON
The wall is 1 inch thick per 2 caster levels. If you create
an unattached wall, you can weight it so there is a 75%
chance it falls on its own in the direction you want. Subtract 5
from the DC to push it in the direction you want, and add 5 to
the DC to push the wall in the other direction.
Augmented (7th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, one
side of the wall (your choice) has a powerful magnetic charge that
attracts metal within 10 feet. The wall automatically attempts a
combat maneuver check to pull once per round against any creature
that comes in range wearing metal armor, wielding a metal
weapon, or otherwise carrying a significant amount of metal.
The wall’s CMB is equal to your caster level plus your tier. If
the combat maneuver succeeds, the creature is pulled 5 feet
closer to the wall. The wall gains a +5 bonus on its combat
maneuver check if the creature is within 5 feet. If the wall
succeeds at its check against a creature within 5 feet, the
creature is pulled up against the wall and is treated as grappled.
Dropping metal items or removing metal armor allows a
creature to free itself from the wall. The magnetic charge fades
after 1 hour per tier. Wrenching an item away from the wall
requires a successful Strength check (DC 10 + the wall’s CMB).
WALL OF STONE
The wall is 1 inch thick per 2 caster levels. The wall’s hardness
increases to 12.
Augmented (7th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the wall is impassable to ethereal travel and spells such as
passwall and phase door. The wall is immune to non-mythic
disintegrate, shatter, sympathetic vibration, and other nonmythic
magical effects that specifically affect stone (including
earthquake, soften earth and stone, and transmute rock to mud).
WALL OF THORNS
The damage dealt increases to 30 minus the creature’s AC. Any
creature adjacent to the wall is automatically grappled by it.
Any creature that begins its turn grappled by the wall takes 2d6
points of damage. Half of this damage is bludgeoning, and the
other half is piercing. For the purpose of escaping this grapple,
the wall’s CMD is 10 + your caster level + your tier.
Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the wall automatically grapples creatures other than you within
10 feet. Any creature grappled by the wall takes 2d6 points of
bleed damage. If a creature doesn’t escape the wall’s grapple,
on its next turn the wall automatically pins it.
WEB
The webs are filled with spider swarms (one spider swarm for
each 10-foot-by-10-foot area covered in webs). Any creature
caught in or moving through the webs is attacked by a spider
swarm (or multiple swarms, if it passes through the space of more
than one swarm). The spiders don’t leave the area of webbing.
Destroying the web in an area destroys the swarm there as well,
and completely destroying the web destroys all the swarms.
Augmented (5th): If you expend two uses of mythic power,
the webs increase to a 50-foot-radius spread. Webs span any
gaps between available anchor points in the area, possibly
creating multiple non-contiguous webbed areas. Non-mythic
abilities that make creatures immune to webs (such as freedom
of movement) instead give them a +5 bonus on saves, combat
maneuver checks, and Escape Artist checks against mythic web.
WHIRLWIND
The cyclone becomes 15 feet wide at the base, 40 feet wide
at the top, and 40 feet tall. The cyclone’s effect on Large or
smaller creatures also applies to Huge creatures, and its damage
increases to 3d8 points of damage. The effect on Medium
or smaller creatures also applies to Large creatures, and the
damage it deals each turn increases to 2d6 points of damage.
Augmented (8th): If you expend three uses of mythic
power, the cyclone’s size increases to 50 feet wide at the
base, 150 feet wide at the top, and 150 feet tall. Creatures and
objects of all sizes touched by the whirlwind take 8d8 points
of damage (Reflex negates), and the damage dealt to those
trapped in the cyclone increases to 6d6 points of damage per
round. Additionally, unattended objects smaller than 30 feet to
a side are swept up in the effect. The area within 20 feet of the
whirlwind is treated as severe wind (Core Rulebook 439), and
within 40 feet it is treated as strong wind.
WISH
When using mythic wish to duplicate another spell, you can duplicate a mythic spell you know (if you’re a spontaneous caster) or have prepared (if you’re a caster who prepares spells). If you don’t know or haven’t prepared the mythic spell, you can expend a second use of mythic power to duplicate the mythic version of the desired spell. You can also produce any one of the following effects that modify or replace effects listed in the non-mythic wish spell description: • If you use mythic wish to remove injuries and afflictions, you can expend a number of uses of mythic power to remove that number of additional afflictions from all affected creatures. • If you use mythic wish to revive the dead, you can expend a second use of mythic power to negate the target’s permanent negative level from the resurrection. • Alter fate. By expending a second use of mythic power, you can cast mythic wish as an immediate action before a 1d20 roll is attempted and choose what number you want to come up on the die. Augmented: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can cast a silent, stilled mythic wish, even if you’re helpless or couldn’t otherwise take actions (but not unconscious).
WORD OF CHAOS
When determining the spell’s effect on non-mythic creatures, add your tier to your caster level. Non-chaotic creatures that fail their saves against the spell also take a –4 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws, and their spell resistance decreases by 5 for as long as the spell’s other effects last.
