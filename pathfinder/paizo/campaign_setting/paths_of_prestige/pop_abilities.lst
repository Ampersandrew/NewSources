You gain a +%1 profane bonus on attack rolls and caster level checks against the target, and the target takes a -%1 penalty on saving throws against your attacks (or -%2 if the attack is a conjuration effect).

Blackfire Eruption	KEY:Blackfire Adept ~ Blackfire Eruption	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike																														DESC:You can sacrifice a prepared spell or spell slot of 4th level or higher, calling forth a searing ebon vortex in the spell's stead. A blackfire eruption acts as unholy blight, but its maximum damage is increased by 1d8 points (2d6 against good outsiders) per level of the sacrificed spell above 4th.  A blackfire eruption ignores the hardness of objects, as it unravels their fundamental reality. A creature slain or an object destroyed by a blackfire eruption is reduced to ash, as by the disintegrate spell. This is a conjuration effect.
Breaching			KEY:Blackfire Adept ~ Breaching		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																													DESC:When you attempt to call or summon a creature from one of your blackfire pact subtypes into an area where summoning is blocked by a magical effect (such as magic circle against evil, forbiddance, or dimensional lock), or when a creature within 30 feet you have called or summoned from your blackfire pact would have its attacks against a creature blocked by such an effect, as a swift action you can sacrifice a prepared spell or spell slot of the same level as the warding effect.  If your caster level is higher than the caster level of the warding effect, it is immediately negated. If it is the same or lower, a caster level check (DC 11 + the caster level of the warding) is required to negate the warding effect.	DESC:Your breaching can penetrate and destroy an antimagic field, a prismatic sphere, or an extradimensional shelter like a mage's magnificent mansion, though a caster level check is always required regardless of your caster level. You can summon creatures into a naturally magic-dead area (such as the Mana Wastes) with a successful DC 31 caster level check, but the magic-dead area is not negated|PREVARGTEQ:Blackfire_Adept_CFP_Level,10.
Breaching Legion		KEY:Blackfire Adept ~ Breaching Legion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																													DESC:When you summon a creature from one of your blackfire pact subtypes, you can choose to allow that creature to use any innate summoning abilities it possesses. The creatures it summons are not under your control.  Once this decision is made, it cannot be reversed until the summoned creature is sent back to whence it came.
Accursed Sympathy		KEY:Blackfire Adept ~ Accursed Sympathy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																													DESC:Whenever you or your called or summoned creature deals hit point damage to a target affected by your blackfire taint, as a swift action you can increase the damage dealt by the attack by %1 hit points. If the target dies, you gain temporary hit points equal to 1/2 the target's total number of Hit Dice. These temporary hit points last 1 hour and do not stack.|BlackfireAdeptLVL
Riftward Breaching	KEY:Blackfire Adept ~ Riftward Breaching	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																													DESC:Whenever one or more creatures appear via a conjuration effect (including calling, summoning, or teleportation effects) within 30 feet of you, you can as an immediate action unleash a blackfire eruption that targets all such creatures within 30 feet (but does not affect other creatures). Creatures that fail their saving throws are immediately transported to a random plane in the evil Outer Planes as though affected by a planeshift spell.

###Block Class Features
#	DEFINE:XXXXX|0#	BONUS:VAR|XXXXX|BrotherOfTheSealLVL
Unarmed Combat		KEY:Brother of the Seal ~ Unarmed Combat		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A Brother of the Seal’s class levels stack with any monk levels for the purposes of determining his flurry of blows, stunning fist, and unarmed strike class features (including determining damage dealt by his unarmed strike attacks).
Water Splitting Stone	KEY:Brother of the Seal ~ Water Splitting Stone	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:When attacking an object, a Brother of the Seal ignores 1 point of hardness per class level.
Gatekeeper			KEY:Brother of the Seal ~ Gatekeeper		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike		DESC:At 2nd level, a Brother of the Seal may select either hold portal or arcane lock, and he gains the ability to cast the selected spell once per day. Once made, this choice cannot be reversed. At 6th level, and again at 10th level, a Brother of the Seal may cast the selected spell an additional time per day.
Trapfinding			KEY:Brother of the Seal ~ Trapfinding		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 2nd level, a Brother of the Seal adds 1/2 his class level on Perception and Disable Device checks made to find or disarm traps, and he can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.
Runefinding			KEY:Brother of the Seal ~ Runefinding		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 3rd level, a Brother of the Seal’s trapfinding bonus becomes equal to his level while dealing with magical glyphs, symbols, runes, and writings. In addition, he gains the trap spotter rogue talent, but it applies only to trapped magical writings.
Awesome Blow		KEY:Brother of the Seal ~ Awesome Blow		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 4th level, a Brother of the Seal gains Awesome Blow (Bestiary 314) as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites, adding his Wisdom modifier on awesome blow combat maneuver checks and dealing damage to his target equal to that dealt by his unarmed strike.  Hardness ignored by the Brother of the Seal’s water splitting stone ability applies when determining damage dealt to an obstacle while using an awesome blow combat maneuver.&nl;A Brother of the Seal can expend 1 ki point or one use of Stunning Fist in conjunction with this ability to affect a creature of his own size with an awesome blow, or 2 ki points or two uses of Stunning Fist to affect a creature one size larger. Using Stunning Fist or ki points in this fashion has no effect other than increasing the size of creature he can affect with his awesome blow.&nl;At 8th level, a Brother of the Seal can affect creatures up to his size with his Awesome Blow feat without expending a use of Stunning Fist or a ki point. In addition, he may affect a creature of any size larger than itself by spending 1 ki point or one use of Stunning Fist per size category of difference.
Unsealing			KEY:Brother of the Seal ~ Unsealing			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, a Brother of the Seal can attempt to breach magical wards or protections, including abjurations, glyphs, runes, symbols, and other magical writings. He must touch the warded object, creature, or area—which can be done as part of an unarmed strike for normal damage or as a melee touch attack that deals no damage—and expend one use of Stunning Fist to dispel the effect (as dispel magic, caster level equal to his character level).  If the unsealing is successful, the effect is destroyed and the Brother of the Seal suffers no harm from it, even if it normally harms those who touch it. If the unsealing fails, the Brother of the Seal suffers any normal effects for touching the warded area, object, or creature, and it remains intact unless it would normally be destroyed upon being interacted with.
Domino strike		KEY:Brother of the Seal ~ Domino strike		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 6th level, when a Brother of the Seal’s awesome blow combat maneuver succeeds and knocks his target into an obstacle (including another creature), he adds his class level to the normal 1d6 points of damage taken by the target and the obstacle.
Hands of stone		KEY:Brother of the Seal ~ Hands of stone		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 7th level, a Brother of the Seal increases his unarmed strike damage as though he were a creature one size larger.
Rapid slam			KEY:Brother of the Seal ~ Rapid slam		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 8th level, a Brother of the Seal can use his Awesome Blow feat once per round as part of a flurry of blows. Alternatively, he can make an awesome blow combat maneuver as part of a charge or as part of the same standard action he uses to perform another combat feat that involves an attack (such as Cleave or Vital Strike).  He can still only make an awesome blow maneuver once per round regardless of how many attacks he makes.
Cascading strike		KEY:Brother of the Seal ~ Cascading strike	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 9th level, when a Brother of the Seal’s awesome blow maneuver succeeds and knocks the target into another creature of its size or smaller, the Brother of the Seal may attempt an awesome blow combat maneuver at a –2 penalty against this second creature. If successful, the Brother deals his unarmed strike damage to this second target (rather than the normal damage for striking an obstacle) and knocks that target back 10 feet. The Brother of the Seal can make additional awesome blow combat maneuvers each time a target strikes a creature behind it, with a cumulative –2 penalty for each additional target.  All targets must be in a straight line. If a target is knocked simultaneously into several smaller creatures, the Brother can choose only one of them to affect with cascading strike.
Unraveling			KEY:Brother of the Seal ~ Unraveling		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 10th level, a Brother of the Seal’s unsealing ability can destroy force effects and abjuration, conjuration, and evocation effects that create stationary barriers (such as prismatic sphere, tiny hut, or wall of ice), even if the effect cannot normally be subjected to dispel magic.

###Block Class Features
#	DEFINE:XXXXX|0#	BONUS:VAR|XXXXX|ChampionOfIroriLVL
Code of Conduct		KEY:Champion of Irori ~ Code of Conduct		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike		DESC:A champion of Irori embraces law and goodness as other paladins do, conducting himself with honor and protecting the innocent; he loses all class features if he ever willingly commits an evil act. A champion of Irori must avoid entanglements that would distract him from the pursuit of perfection, and may not incur debts nor give loans to others—though he is encouraged to give freely to those in need. He likewise turns away potential followers of any sort, and may not recruit (and must discharge from service, if already acquired) any cohort, follower, animal companion, familiar, special mount, or similar creature.
Detect Chaos		KEY:Champion of Irori ~ Detect Chaos		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike		DESC:This ability functions like a paladin’s detect evil ability, but detects chaos instead of evil.
Martial Artist		KEY:Champion of Irori ~ Martial Artist		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The class levels of a champion of Irori stack with monk levels for determining the effect of his AC bonus, f lurry of blows, stunning fist, and unarmed strike class features.
Smite Chaos			KEY:Champion of Irori ~ Smite Chaos			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 1st level, a champion of Irori gains an additional use of his paladin’s smite evil ability. In addition, he can choose to use his smite evil ability to smite chaos instead, affecting chaotic-aligned creatures and dealing 2 points of damage per class level on the first successful attack against outsiders with the chaotic subtype, chaotic-aligned aberrations, and fey. Levels in this class stack with paladin levels for the purpose of determining how much damage a paladin of Irori deals to targets of his smite. A champion of Irori cannot have both a smite evil and smite chaos effect active at the same time; using one while the other is active immediately ends the older effect. At 8th level, a champion of Irori gains an additional use of his smite evil ability.
Ki Pool			KEY:Champion of Irori ~ Ki Pool			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 2nd level, a champion of Irori gains a ki pool equal to 1/2 his class level + his Wisdom modifier; this functions like the monk ability of the same name, and levels in this class stack with levels in other classes that grant a ki pool. In addition to the normal uses of this ki pool, a champion of Irori may expend 2 ki points to trigger either his lay on hands ability (if he has it) or his smite evil ability. His class levels stack with paladin levels when determining the effect of such abilities.
Pursuit of Knowledge	KEY:Champion of Irori ~ Pursuit of Knowledge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 2nd level, a champion of Irori adds 1/2 his class level on all Knowledge checks and can make Knowledge skill checks untrained.
Sweeping Smite		KEY:Champion of Irori ~ Sweeping Smite		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 3rd level, as a standard action, a champion of Irori can make a single unarmed strike while using his smite evil or smite chaos ability. If the attack hits, he can make another attack at the same bonus against an evil or chaotic creature adjacent to the first and also within reach. He gains the benefits of smite chaos or smite evil (whichever he was already using), except for additional damage for the first attack, against that creature until the beginning of his next turn. This does not require an additional daily use of smite evil or smite chaos.  At 6th level, a champion of Irori can use this ability to attack any number of opponents, as long as each is within his threatened area and adjacent to the previous target. This ability functions similarly to the Cleave and Great Cleave feats, but does not stack with them and does not result in an AC penalty.
Valiant Stand		KEY:Champion of Irori ~ Valiant Stand		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 4th level, a champion of Irori gains a sacred bonus on attack rolls and to AC equal to 1/2 his class level when adjacent to more than one opponent.  He does not gain this bonus if he is also adjacent to an ally.
Shield The Weak		KEY:Champion of Irori ~ Shield The Weak		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, as an immediate action once per round, a champion of Irori can shield a number of adjacent allies equal to his Wisdom modifier from a burst, cone, line, or spread effect that allows a Ref lex saving throw and which he and his allies are all affected by. The champion of Irori must forgo his own saving throw, but adjacent allies gain improved cover against the effect, providing a +4 bonus on Ref lex saves and improved evasion against the effect.
Skill Mastery		KEY:Champion of Irori ~ Skill Mastery		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 6th level, a champion of Irori becomes well practiced in a certain number of his skills. This ability functions exactly like the skill mastery advanced rogue talent.
Perfect Opening		KEY:Champion of Irori ~ Perfect Opening		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 7th level, once per round a champion of Irori can make an attack of opportunity against an enemy he threatens when that enemy confirms a critical hit against the champion or an ally. The champion of Irori can make this attack of opportunity even if he would be killed or incapacitated by the critical hit, resolving the attack after the critical hit deals damage but before he falls unconscious or dies. If the champion of Irori’s attack of opportunity hits, it is automatically a critical threat.
One Finger			KEY:Champion of Irori ~ One Finger			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 8th level, as a standard action, a champion of Irori can resolve a single unarmed attack as a melee touch attack.
Perfect Strike		KEY:Champion of Irori ~ Perfect Strike		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 9th level, a champion of Irori can expend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to perfect the next unarmed attack he makes before the end of his turn. Attack and damage rolls are rolled twice and the champion of Irori selects which result to use.
Whirlwind Smite		KEY:Champion of Irori ~ Whirlwind Smite		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 10th level, as a full-round action, a champion of Irori can make one unarmed strike against every creature he threatens, as if he possessed the Whirlwind Attack feat (though he can use it only with unarmed strikes).  He can also trigger either his smite evil or smite chaos ability while doing so, gaining its benefits against every creature he attacks for a number of rounds equal to his Wisdom bonus.

Instantaneous Toxicology	KEY:DaggerMark Poisoner ~ Instantaneous Toxicology	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:At 8th level, a Daggermark poisoner can create a poison as a full-round action if she succeeds at the Craft (alchemy) check and has the appropriate resources on hand to pay the creation cost. Poisons crafted in this way last up 10 minutes per class level before losing their potency. In addition, she can instead create an unstable toxin.  An unstable toxin costs 1/10 its normal price (rather than 1/3), but is ruined if not used by the end of her next turn.
Master Poisoner			KEY:DaggerMark Poisoner ~ Master Poisoner			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:A Daggermark poisoner adds 1/2 her level on Craft (alchemy) checks dealing with poison. In addition, she can use Craft (alchemy) to change the type of a poison with 1 hour of work and an alchemist's lab. If the Craft (alchemy) check (DC equals the poison's save DC) is successful, the poison's type changes to contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury; on a failed check, the poison is ruined.
Poison Resistance			KEY:DaggerMark Poisoner ~ Poison Resistance		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:A Daggermark poisoner gains a +2 bonus on saves against poison, increasing to +4 at 4th level, +6 at 7th level, and total immunity at 9th level.

The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 at 5th level and again at 10th. If a Daggermark poisoner gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.

This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity as long as she has at least one hand free.
Toxic Apothecary			KEY:DaggerMark Poisoner ~ Toxic Apothecary		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Spelllike	DESC:At 2nd level, a Daggermark poisoner can use detect poison at will (range 5 feet, caster level equal to the Daggermark poisoner's class level) as a swift action. She gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her class level on Heal checks dealing with poison, and on a successful check she adds this bonus to the save bonus she provides her patient against the treated poison.
Toxic Manufacture			KEY:DaggerMark Poisoner ~ Toxic Manufacture		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:At 3rd level, when creating poisons or antitoxins a Daggermark poisoner can create a number of doses equal to her Intelligence modifier at one time (minimum 1). These additional doses do not increase the time required, but do increase the raw material cost accordingly. In addition, she uses the item's gp value as its sp value when determining progress made with her Craft (alchemy) checks. If the Daggermark poisoner has the Master AlchemistAPG feat, she may create a number of doses of poison or antitoxin at one time equal to twice her Intelligence modifier and uses the item's pp value as its sp value when determining progress with her Craft (alchemy) checks.

Trapster				KEY:DaggerMark Poisoner ~ Trapster				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:At 3rd level, a Daggermark poisoner adds her class level on Perception skill checks made to locate traps and on Craft and Disable Device checks made with poisonous traps.

###Block Class Features
Divine Deception		KEY:Dawnflower Dissident ~ Divine Deception		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A Dawnflower dissident adds a sacred bonus equal to 1/2 his level on Bluff or Sense Motive checks to send, interpret, or intercept coded messages, and increases the DC of Spellcraft checks made to identify his spells by the same amount.  He also adds the following spells to his spell list: illusion of calm (1st), rope trick (2nd), nondetection (3rd), detect scrying (4th), mage's private sanctum (5th), veil (6th), mage's magnificent mansion (7th), screen (8th), and communal mind blank (9th). In addition, the duration of these spells doubles when they target worshipers of Sarenrae (including the caster).  This does not affect the level of the spell or its casting time, and does not stack with feats or effects such as Extend Spell.
Eschew Materials		KEY:Dawnflower Dissident ~ Eschew Materials		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A Dawnflower dissident gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat, and he can ignore any divine focus (holy symbol) components for his spells.
Secret Caster		KEY:Dawnflower Dissident ~ Secret Caster			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 2nd level, a Dawnflower dissident can disguise his spellcasting with a Bluff check (for spells with verbal components), opposed by the observer's Sense Motive check, and/or a Sleight of Hand check (for spells with somatic components), opposed by the observer's Perception check.  Depending on the situation, the Dawnflower dissident's Bluff and/ or Sleight of Hand check is modified according to the following table.Spell has a range of personal - -0; During combat - -5; Spell has a range of touch - -5; Spell has a range longer than touch - -10; Spell has a visible; audible; or otherwise observable effect - -Spell level ×2; Spell has an observable effect that clearly emanates from the caster - Automatic failure; Casting a spell in this fashion increases its casting time to a full-round action (if normally a standard action or less), or doubles the casting time of spells with a casting time longer than a full-round action. A spell cast in this way does not provoke attacks of opportunity from observers that fail to recognize it for what it is. For spells with both verbal and somatic components, the spell still provokes attacks of opportunity from observers unless they fail both their Sense Motive and Perception checks.
Schismatic Apostle	KEY:Dawnflower Dissident ~ Schismatic Apostle		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 3rd level, a Dawnflower dissident adds a +1 bonus to the DC of mind-affecting effects used against followers of both Sarenrae and Rovagug. If he is an inquisitor, any bonuses he gains from his judgment increase by 1 when used against followers of Sarenrae or Rovagug.
Burning Blade		KEY:Dawnflower Dissident ~ Burning Blade			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 4th level, a Dawnflower dissident can expend one use of channel energy as a swift action to grant a scimitar he touches the flaming weapon special ability for 1 round per 1d6 points of damage the channeled energy would normally heal. If a worshiper of Sarenrae wields the scimitar and strikes another worshiper of Sarenrae, as a free action the wielder may choose to make all damage from the attack nonlethal, as if wielding a weapon with the merciful weapon special ability. An inquisitor may instead choose to expend one use of his judgment ability to imbue the scimitar with the flaming weapon special ability for a number of rounds equal to his caster level, or may use this ability in place of his bane ability.  At 8th level, this power grants the touched scimitar the flaming burst weapon special ability instead.
Shift Blame			KEY:Dawnflower Dissident ~ Shift Blame			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 6th level, when a Dawnflower dissident provokes an attack of opportunity, he can attempt to deceive the creature making the attack of opportunity into believing the provoking action was performed by another creature as long as it is adjacent to the Dawnflower dissident and also threatened by the attacker. Doing so requires a Bluff check opposed by the attacker's Sense Motive check. The attacker gains a bonus equal to its base attack bonus on this Sense Motive check. If the Bluff check is successful, the attack of opportunity instead targets an adjacent creature chosen by the Dawnflower dissident, and the attacker must reroll her attack roll to see whether she hits this new target.
Morning Light		KEY:Dawnflower Dissident ~ Morning Light			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 9th level, a Dawnflower dissident can spend a full-round action reciting the litany of Sarenrae's renewing wisdom while expending two uses of channel energy or one use of his judgment ability. This grants each ally within 15 feet of him a new saving throw against any one ongoing condition or effect that allows a save. This does not affect instantaneous or permanent effects or effects that do not allow a saving throw. Allies that worship Sarenrae (including the Dawnflower dissident) can instead attempt a new saving throw against every ongoing condition or effect that allows a save.
Flight of the Phoenix	KEY:Dawnflower Dissident ~ Flight of the Phoenix	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 10th level, when a Dawnflower dissident is killed his body is engulfed in a column of holy fire equivalent to a flame strike at his caster level. At the beginning of his next turn, his spirit returns in the form of a phoenix (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 227) that fights as he directs for up to 1 minute and then disappears.  This phoenix is not considered called or summoned. The Dawnflower dissident is reborn (as resurrection) 1d4 rounds after it disappears in a random location within 1 mile, with his gear intact but with two permanent negative levels. If the phoenix is killed before it disappears, the Dawnflower dissident cannot be reborn via this ability, though other methods of raising him still work.
