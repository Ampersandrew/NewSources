The wielder make one attack roll when firing a nuclear resonator, then resolves that roll against the Armor Class of every creature in an 80 foot line from his position. The resonator's beam tunes itself to the precise molecular structure of the first creature in the line he hits, dealing 9d6 points of sonic damage to that target. Any other targets of the same creature type in the line which are subsequently struck take 5d6 points of sonic damage, while creatures of different types than the initial target take 3d6 points of sonic damage. If the attack roll is a critical threat, choose one target hit by the attack to resolve the critical confirmation against. A creature that's critically hit b y a nuclear resonator must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw to resist being stunned for 1 round and deafened for 1d6 rounds. A creature slain by a nuclear resonator is completely disintegrated (any gear carried remains unaffected).

This weapon damages all targets with an AC equal to or lower than the attack roll. However, if the attack's damage fails to penetrate any target's hardness or damage reduction, this shot is blocked and cannot damage targets that are farther away.

By activating a control in the handle as a swift action, the wielder can switch the attack between a nonlethal jolt and a lethal shock. On a confirmed critical hit, a target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + the damage dealt by the critical hit) or be staggered for 1 round. When it's not activated, a stun baton functions as a sap. A character who is proficient with saps is proficient with a stun baton .
Stun Gun		COST:3000	SOURCEPAGE:p.28	WIELD:OneHanded	TYPE:One-Handed Ranged.Ranged.Weapon.OneHanded.Nonlethal		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Stun Gun			DAMAGE:1d8	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	RANGE:20	QUALITY:Capacity|10	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge	QUALITY:Special|semi-automatic, touch	WT:3	SPROP:A hit by a stun gun deals nonlethal damage-on a critical hit, the gun can attempt a free trip combat maneuver check against the target (CMB = user's base attack bonus + 1 0); this attempt doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.

A critical hit also allows the user of the gun to attempt a trip combat maneuver check against the target (CMB = user's base attack bonus + 15); this attempt doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Flying creatures struck by a vortex gun are affected as if they were struck by hurricane force winds. A creature protected by a force field takes no damage from a vortex gun but must succeed at a DC 1 8 Reflex save or the shot automatically depletes all of the force field's remaining hit points.
X-Laser		COST:40000	SOURCEPAGE:p.28	WIELD:TwoHanded	TYPE:Two-Handed Ranged.Ranged.Weapon.TwoHanded.Fire		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|X-Laser			DAMAGE:5d6	CRITMULT:x4	CRITRANGE:1	RANGE:200	QUALITY:Capacity|20	QUALITY:Usage|5 charges	QUALITY:Special|touch	WT:	SPROP:The beam is stopped if it can not penetrate the hardness, fire resistance, or fire immunity of a barrier or creature. When making an attack with an x-laser, make a single attack roll and compare that result to the ACs of all creatures in a line extending out to the weapon's maximum range. This weapon damages all targets with an AC equal to or lower than the attack roll.
