Enlightened paladins follow no universal paladin code - each paladin in his service creates his own code as part of his spiritual journey, seeing the adherence to such a self-formulated creed as one of the many tests one must face to reach perfection.

Skills			KEY:Enlightened Paladin ~ Skills			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PaladinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:An Enlightened paladin gains Acrobatics, Climb, and Swim as class skills.	CSKILL:Acrobatics|Climb|Swim
Confident Defense		KEY:Enlightened Paladin ~ Confident Defense	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PaladinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, when wearing light or no armor and not using a shield, an Enlightened paladin adds 1 point of his Charisma bonus (if any) per class level to his Dexterity bonus to his Armor Class. If he is caught flat-footed or otherwise denied his Dexterity bonus, he also loses this bonus. This ability replaces his proficiency with medium armor, heavy armor, and shields.	BONUS:COMBAT|AC|min(CHA,PaladinLVL)
Unarmed Strike		KEY:Enlightened Paladin ~ Unarmed Strike		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PaladinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, an Enlightened paladin gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. In addition, he gains the unarmed strike monk ability, treating his monk level as half his paladin level (minimum 1) for calculating his unarmed strike damage.	AUTO:FEAT|Improved Unarmed Strike	ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Monk ~ Unarmed Damage	BONUS:VAR|MonkUnarmedDamageLVL|PaladinLVL/2
Aura of Law			KEY:Enlightened Paladin ~ Aura of Law		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PaladinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The power of an enlightened paladin's aura of law is equal to his class level. This ability replaces aura of good.	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Aura of Good
Sense Perfection		KEY:Enlightened Paladin ~ Sense Perfection	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PaladinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, at will, an enlightened paladin can detect life forces as if he were using a paladin's detect evil class ability; however, instead of sensing evil creatures, he senses creatures that have a ki pool. Each such creature has an aura like a cleric of an aligned deity, and treats its current number of ki points as its Hit Dice for the purposes of this ability. This ability replaces detect evil.
Personal Trial		KEY:Enlightened Paladin ~ Personal Trial		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PaladinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Once per day, an enlightened paladin can as a swift action declare one target within line of sight as his personal trial. The Enlightened paladin gains a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against that creature, to his AC against attacks made by the target, and on saving throws against the target's spells and special abilities. This bonus increases by 1 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum bonus of +6 at 20th level. The personal trial effect remains until the target of the trial is dead or the next time the paladin rests and regains daily uses of this ability. At 4th level and every three levels thereafter, the Enlightened paladin can use personal trial one additional time per day. This ability replaces smite evil.
Aura of Excellence	KEY:Enlightened Paladin ~ Aura of Excellence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PaladinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 3rd level, an enlightened paladin is immune to any effect that would force him to reroll a die against his will or roll twice and take the lower result. Whenever an ally within 10 feet of him would reroll a die against her will, she can roll twice and take the higher result. Whenever an ally within 10 feet would be forced to roll twice and take the lower result, she can instead roll three times and take the second-lowest result. This ability functions only while the Enlightened paladin is conscious, and replaces aura of courage.
Ki Pool			KEY:Enlightened Paladin ~ Ki Pool			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PaladinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 4th level, an enlightened paladin gains a ki pool with an effective monk level equal to his class level. The number of points in an Enlightened paladin's ki pool is equal to 1/2 his class level + his Charisma modifier. By spending 1 point from his ki pool, he can ignore any damage reduction possessed by the target of his personal trial ability for 1 round. This ability otherwise functions as the monk ability of the same name and replaces channel positive energy.	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Monk ~ Ki Pool	DEFINE:KiPoolCha|0	BONUS:VAR|KiPoolCha|1	BONUS:VAR|KiPoolLVL|PaladinLVL/2
Divine Body			KEY:Enlightened Paladin ~ Divine Body		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PaladinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Upon reaching 5th level, an enlightened paladin must form a bond with a weapon, except he can only choose to enhance his unarmed strike. This ability otherwise functions as and replaces divine bond.	ABILITY:Paladin Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Divine Bond ~ Celestial Spirit
Aura of Perfection	KEY:Enlightened Paladin ~ Aura of Perfection	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PaladinClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 11th level, whenever an enlightened paladin or ally within 10 feet would reroll a die and take the second result even if it is lower (via the good fortune ability of the Luck domain, for example), he can roll an additional die as part of the reroll and use the higher of the two as the result of the reroll. This ability functions only while the Enlightened paladin is conscious, and replaces aura of justice.
