The gravity elemental gains the grappled condition as long as it has a creature engulfed, and it can only engulf one creature at a time.  A creature that dies while engulfed by a gravity elemental is smashed into atoms and can only be restored to life by a miracle, wish, or the intervention of a deity.

The maximum weight an Elder gravity elemental can lift with its telekinesis is not restricted to 375 lbs. The effects of the gravity field are centered on the gravity elemental and move with it. Additionally, by increasing the pull of gravity around itself a gravity elemental can make creatures within a certain radius too heavy to move, or crush them to a pulp.  Hold: As a full-round action a gravity elemental can cause all corporeal creatures in its area of effect to become too heavy to move. Creatures in the gravity elemental's gravity field must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the held condition until the gravity elemental releases them or they break free. A flying creature has a -4 penalty applied to the save; failure means it is unable to remain airborne and must land. The check DC is Strength-based. The gravity elemental can maintain this ability each round as a fullround action.  The area of effect and save DC depend on the size of the elemental. If the gravity elemental maintains this ability, on successive rounds a held creature can break free by succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to the initial Fortitude save. Any land-bound creature two size categories smaller less than the elemental has its speed automatically reduced by half, even if the Strength check is successful.  This ability only works on creatures with weight and mass; incorporeal and gaseous creatures are immune to this power.  Crush: Once per day per 2HD, as a standard action, a gravity elemental can increase the gravity around itself to crushing proportions. Anything within the gravity elemental's gravity field takes bludgeoning damage. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The area of effect and save DC depend on the elemental's size.

The target can make a successful Will save to resist the attempt. On a successful save, that target is immune to the fascination ability of that graymalkin for 24 hours.  If the save fails, the target becomes fascinated with the graymalkin and "adopts" it as a pet, becoming its new owner. The owner clings to the cat and always keeps it close by, feeling withdrawn and lethargic if the graymalkin is farther away. A fascinated target resists any urges or suggestions to rid itself of its new found friend, even to the point of becoming combative and enraged. This fascination lasts until the graymalkin is killed, the owner dies, or the graymalkin remains more than 20 feet away from its owner for at least 24 hours. The effect is otherwise similar to a charm person spell (caster level equals the graymalkin's HD). A graymalkin can only ever have one owner at a single time. If it uses its fascination ability against another creature, that target becomes its new owner on a failed save. All fascination effects on its previous owner are immediately dispelled. The save DC is Charisma-based.

The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Keening				KEY:GroaningSpirit ~ Keening	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GroaningSpiritRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Once per day, at night only, a groaning spirit can release a death wail audible to a range of 1 mile.  All creatures within 30 feet that hear this must make a successful DC 21 Will save or be affected as per the wail of the banshee spell. Those that make their save still take 3d6+7 points of damage.

### Gryph

Racial Abilities	KEY:Gryph ~ Racial Abilities		CATEGORY:Internal	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE:GryphRaceAbility
Attach		KEY:Gryph ~ Attach	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GryphRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:When a gryph hits with its legs, its talons latch tightly onto the target, anchoring it in place. An attached gryph is effectively grappling its prey. The gryph loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 11, but holds on with great tenacity and gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls with its bite. Alternatively, an attached gryph can attempt to implant eggs in the target. An attached gryph has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached gryph can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the gryph is removed.
Implant Eggs	KEY:Gryph ~ Implant Eggs	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GryphRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Once per day, a gryph can implant eggs into a helpless target or a target that it is currently attached to as a full-round action by extending an ovipositor from its abdomen and penetrating the victim's flesh by making a successful +4 melee attack. On a hit, the ovipositor inflicts 1 damage and implants 1d4 eggs into the victim's body. As long as a victim has gryph eggs implanted in his body, he is sickened as the eggs draw nutrients from his blood and flesh. The eggs grow swiftly, hatching in a mere 1d4 minutes into ravenous baby gryphs that immediately burrow out of the victim's body. This inflicts 2 points of Constitution damage per baby gryph, after which the hatchlings immediately take wing and fly away.  Treat a gryph hatchling as a bat if statistics are needed.  Gryph eggs can be cut out of a victim's body with a successful DC 20 Heal check made as a full-round action that inflicts 1 point of damage per attempt. Although immunity to disease offers no special protection against gryph egg implantation, remove disease or heal immediately destroys any implanted gryph eggs.

Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or be affected as if by a charm monster spell for 2d6 minutes. Affected creatures believe the tree to be of some ordinary sort (or to be a treant or other such friendly tree creature). An affected creature becomes passive and refuses to attack the hangman tree during this time. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.  An affected creature can attempt a new Will save (DC 19, +1 per previous save) each round. A creature that makes its save cannot be affected by the hallucinatory spores of that hangman's tree for 24 hours.

Vines				KEY:HangmanTree ~ Vines	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HangmanTreeRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The vines of a hangman tree have 10 hit points and can be attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. Attacking a hangman tree's vine does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the vine is currently grappling a target, the hangman tree takes a -4 penalty on its opposed attack roll to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a vine deals no damage to a hangman tree.

### Haunt

Racial Abilities	KEY:Haunt ~ Racial Abilities		CATEGORY:Internal	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE:HauntRaceAbility
Alternate Form	KEY:Haunt ~ Alternate Form	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HauntRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A haunt's natural form is that of a translucent image appearing much as the person did in life. As a standard action, it can alter its form so as to appear as a floating, luminescent ball of light (possibly being mistaken for a will-o'-wisp in this form). In this form, it cannot use its Dexterity damage attack or its malevolence attack. It retains its incorporeal form and can make an incorporeal touch attack that deals normal damage (but not Dex damage).  A haunt remains in one form or the other until it chooses to assume a new one (as a standard action). A change in form cannot be dispelled. A haunt cannot change forms while using its malevolence attack (that is, while possessing a host).
Malevolence		KEY:Haunt ~ Malevolence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HauntRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Once per round, a haunt can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane whose Dexterity has been reduced to 0 (either through the haunt's touch or by some other means). This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th or the haunt's Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the haunt must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 14 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same haunt's malevolence for 24 hours.  If the save fails, the haunt vanishes into the target's body (whose Dexterity temporarily returns to normal) and attempts to complete its unfinished task.  If the haunt completes its task, it leaves the host and fades away forever. When the haunt leaves the host, the host's Dexterity drops back to 0. If the host body is slain while the haunt is in possession of it, the creature becomes tied to that area and can never leave. Its unfinished task remains the same.
Rejuvenation	KEY:Haunt ~ Rejuvenation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HauntRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a haunt through simple combat: the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 1d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently destroy a haunt is to use dispel evil/good/law/chaos (depending on the haunt's alignment) or determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different ghost by the GM.
Strangle		KEY:Haunt ~ Strangle	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HauntRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:If a creature possessed by a haunt has an alignment opposite to that of the haunt on either the law/ chaos or good/evil axis, it attempts to strangle the host using its own hands (i.e., the hands of the host body). Unless precautions are taken to restrain the possessed victim's hands, they immediately reach for the throat and begin strangling the haunt-possessed body. An opponent takes 1d4 points of damage each round until its hands are forcibly restrained with a successful CMB check, the haunt is ejected from the body, or the victim dies.
Vulnerability	KEY:Haunt ~ Vulnerability	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HauntRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A haunt can be forcibly ejected from a host if hold person is cast on the victim and the haunt fails its Will save. A dispel evil/good/law/chaos spell (depending on the haunt's alignment) instantly ejects the creature from the host and deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the haunt. A haunt slain in such a manner cannot rejuvenate and is permanently destroyed.

Holocone		KEY:Hawanar ~ Holocone	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HawanarRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A hawanar can transform into a vortex of embers and white-hot fire once every 10 minutes.

Racial Abilities	KEY:HellMoth ~ Racial Abilities		CATEGORY:Internal	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE:HellMothRaceAbility

Attacks that hit an engulfing hell moth deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.
Immolation		KEY:HellMoth ~ Immolation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HellMothRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A hell moth that has engulfed an opponent can detonate its body in a blast of hellish fire that deals 6d10 points of fire damage to itself and the engulfed opponent (no save). (Reduce the damage dealt to the hell moth by its fire resistance.) A hell moth can immolate itself once every 3 hours (providing it survives the immolation).  Creatures within 10 feet of the hell moth when it uses this ability must succeed on a DC 17 Reflex save or take 1d8 points of fire damage as clothes and combustibles ignite. The damage continues for another 1d4+4 rounds after the hell moth uses this ability or until the fire is extinguished. The save DC is Constitution-based.

This allows the hellstoker to fire a jet of flame from its bellows in a line to a range of 30 feet, once per round as a standard action. It must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit a foe. A creature hit by the fire takes 1d8 points of fire damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or catch on fire.
Fiery Body		KEY:HellstokerDevil ~ Fiery Body	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HellstokerDevilRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The oil coating a hellstoker's body is highly flammable. As such, a hellstoker hit with a fire effect bursts into flames. This deals no damage to the hellstoker, and deals 1d6 points of fire damage to any creature touching or grappling the hellstoker. The fire burns for 10 rounds before extinguishing. This does not damage the hellstoker's oily hide; therefore, it still retains its racial bonus to Escape Artist checks (see oily hide below), and it can be caught on fire again.
Oily Hide		KEY:HellstokerDevil ~ Oily Hide	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HellstokerDevilRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Hellstokers do not secrete oil naturally, but their constant contact with it leaves them coated with a thick layer of the substance at all times. This grants hellstokers a +10 racial bonus to Escape Artist checks (included in the statistics block). The oil cannot be washed off or removed.  Additionally, if a hellstoker is hit with a fire effect, it bursts into flames. See the hellstoker's fiery body above for details.

Bladed Lid			KEY:IronMaidenGolem ~ Bladed Lid	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:IronMaidenGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A living creature inside an iron maiden when the lid is closed is pierced by twenty dagger-like blades, dealing a total of 50 points of piercing damage each round. The lid automatically seals with an arcane lock spell with a caster level equal to that of the iron maiden golem's creator (14th level usually). The lid can be forced open with a successful Strength check (DC 34) or by casting dispel magic. The knock spell has no effect on the lid. The check DC is Strength-based and includes a +10 bonus from the arcane lock spell.  Because of the shape of the iron maiden, only a Medium humanoid can be sealed inside.
Immunity to Magic		KEY:IronMaidenGolem ~ Immunity to Magic	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:IronMaidenGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:An iron maiden golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an iron maiden golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.  A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the iron maiden golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.
Steal Essence		KEY:IronMaidenGolem ~ Steal Essence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:IronMaidenGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:An iron maiden golem that has created a host using its animate host ability (see above) gains 10 temporary hit points, uses its own base attack bonus or the host's (whichever is higher), and can make normal use of the victim's skills, feats, and non-magical class abilities.  The golem must substitute its own ability scores when determining its total skill bonuses; therefore it cannot use skills requiring Constitution or Intelligence, and since it cannot speak, many Charisma skills are severely limited. Likewise, the iron maiden golem must meet the requirements for any feat in order to make use of that feat (thus feats such as Dodge and Combat Expertise are unavailable to the golem). An iron maiden cannot use any divine spells or divinely granted special abilities, since the host within is no longer able to receive such abilities from her deity. An iron maiden likewise cannot use any arcane spells as its inherent magic immunity disrupts any attempt to do so.
Vulnerability to Rust	KEY:IronMaidenGolem ~ Vulnerability to Rust	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:IronMaidenGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:An iron maiden golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as that of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.

Non-lawful creatures take 6d6 points of force damage (no save) and are stunned for 1d4 rounds (DC 26 Fortitude save negates).

The target can make a DC 17 Will save to avoid the effects. If the save fails, the victim believes the kelpie to be a very beautiful and attractive creature, and attempts to move as quickly as possible toward the kelpie.  The kelpie can automatically grapple a charmed foe and attempts to drown the victim. A charmed foe does not resist the kelpie's embrace, and the drowning attempt does not allow an additional save. Female creatures are immune to the kelpie's charm ability; only males can be affected.

Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence.

Rend Armor		KEY:Khargra ~ Rend Armor	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KhargraRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:If a khargra hits with a bite attack, it deals normal bite damage and pulls apart any metal armor worn by its foe. This attack deals 2d8+2 points of damage to the opponent's armor. Creatures wearing no armor or non-metal armor are unaffected by this special attack (though they still take normal bite damage).

Note, against a khargra, a weapon or shield's hardness is only one-half as effective as normal. This means that a light steel shield, for example, is considered to have a hardness of 5 rather than 10 against a khargra's sunder attack. A weapon or shield reduced to 0 or less hit points is destroyed and half of it is swallowed by the khargra.  It only uses this special attack against metal weapons and shields. Damaged armor and weapons gain the broken condition.
Vulnerabilities	KEY:Khargra ~ Vulnerabilities	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:KhargraRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A khargra takes maximum damage from a heat metal spell (no save).

The DC increases by +1 for every hit point the character is below 0 (e.g., a character at -3 hit points must save at DC 20). Once captured, the lantern goat slowly digests the creature's soul over a period of 1 hour, using it to fuel its dark energies. A creature slain in this manner can only be returned to life by a resurrection, true resurrection, wish, or miracle. Raise dead has no effect on such a slain creature.

After that, the victim must make a successful Constitution check (DC 10, +1 per previous check) each round to continue holding its breath. If the victim fails a check, it drowns. In the first round, the victim falls unconscious (0 hp). In the next round, the creature is dying (-1 hp), and in the third round the victim drowns.  Lava Pool: A lava weird's pool is a bubbling, churning, morass of molten rock mixed with elemental fire. Flammable materials that contact the lava pool automatically catch fire on the round contact is made. Creatures touching the pool take 2d8 points of fire damage per round of contact. Damage from the lava pool continues for 1d3 rounds after contact ceases, but this extra damage is only half of that dealt during contact (1d8 points of damage).

Spawn are under the command of the mortuary cyclone that created them and remain enslaved until its destruction. See the sidebar for the type of undead creatures a mortuary cyclone can spawn.
Desecrating Aura		KEY:MortuaryCyclone ~ Desecrating Aura	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MortuaryCycloneRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A mortuary cyclone emanates an aura of desecration within a 50-foot radius centered on its body.  This functions as a desecrate spell (caster level 18th) as if the mortuary cyclone where a permanent fixture dedicated to its own deity. Clerics in the area take a -6 profane penalty on turning checks, undead within the area gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves, and undead created within the area have +2 hit points per HD. Further, anyone casting animate dead within 50 feet of a mortuary cyclone creates as many as double the normal amount of undead (4 HD per caster level instead of 2 HD per caster level).  A consecrate spell cast on a mortuary cyclone by a caster of 18th level or higher nullifies its desecrating aura for 1 minute per caster level.
Necrocone			KEY:MortuaryCyclone ~ Necrocone	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MortuaryCycloneRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Once every 1d4 rounds, a mortuary cyclone can blast forth a mass of bone fragments, debris and negative energy in a 30-foot cone. Creatures caught in the cone take 6d6 points of damage. Half this damage is piercing damage, but the other half is from negative energy and is not subject to resistance or immunity (unless the opponent is resistant or immune to negative energy effects). An affected creature that succeeds on a DC 27 Reflex save reduces the piercing damage by half. Undead within the area of a necrocone heal a number of hit points equal to the amount of negative energy damage (3d6) the attack would otherwise deal. An undead creature cannot gain temporary or bonus hit points from a mortuary cyclone's necrocone. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Immortality		KEY:MouseLord ~ Immortality	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MouseLordRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The Mouse Lord is effectively immortal and nearly impossible to slay. When slain, the Mouse Lord's soul reforms on the Astral Plane. Within one week, it inhabits another mouse or rat on the Material Plane and the Mouse Lord reforms. No form of magic (such as magic that would contain or trap her soul) prevents this. To permanently kill the Mouse Lord, one must destroy every mouse and rat in existence (so her soul has no creature to inhabit).
Keen Senses		KEY:MouseLord ~ Keen Senses	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MouseLordRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The Mouse Lord sees four times as well as a human in shadowy illumination and twice as well in normal light.

### Mudbog

Racial Abilities	KEY:Mudbog ~ Racial Abilities		CATEGORY:Internal	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE:MudbogRaceAbility
Acid			KEY:Mudbog ~ Acid	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudbogRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A mudbog secretes a digestive acid that quickly dissolves organic material, but not metal or stone. Any melee hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Armor or clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save. A wooden weapon that strikes a mudbog dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save. The mudbog's acidic touch deals 17 points of acid damage per round to wooden objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Camouflage		KEY:Mudbog ~ Camouflage	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudbogRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The consistency and coloration of a mudbog makes it difficult to discern from a normal patch of mud. Any creature within 10 feet of a mudbog must make a DC 20 Perception or Survival check to determine the actual nature of the creature.
Engulf		KEY:Mudbog ~ Engulf	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudbogRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A Medium or smaller opponent that walks into a mudbog is automatically grappled and takes 1d6 acid damage each round the mudbog maintains the hold.  Engulfed creatures are considered to be grappled and are trapped within the mudbog's body. This ability otherwise functions as swallow whole, save that a creature that cut its way out of a mudbog leaves no hole in the protoplas creature's body.

### Mudman

Racial Abilities		KEY:Mudman ~ Racial Abilities		CATEGORY:Internal	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE:MudmanRaceAbility
Engulf			KEY:Mudman ~ Engulf	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Once per minute as a standard action, a mudman can hurl itself at any creature of its size or smaller within 10 feet. If it succeeds on a ranged touch attack, the mudman immediately makes a CMB check to grapple the target (this does not provoke an attack of opportunity) with a +4 racial bonus. If the mudman fails to establish a hold, it drops into an adjacent square and is staggered for 1 round. If the mudman establishes a hold, it flows over its opponent, covering the creature with its muddy body-it can attempt a new CMB check to maintain the "hold" on the creature each round that follows as a free action. The creature is effectively blinded and must either hold its breath or suffocate as long as the mudman retains its hold. Each round the mudman maintains its hold, it deals 1d4+3 points of damage as it crushes and constricts its victims.
Magic Vulnerability	KEY:Mudman ~ Magic Vulnerability	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Mudmen are particularly susceptible to dispel magic, as this spell disrupts the magical energies in their bodies. A mudman subjected to dispel magic takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (Fortitude save for half damage). Transmute mud to rock deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to any mudmen caught in the area of effect and leaves them staggered until they can find a new mud pool. Other, similar spells may have similar effects.
Mud Bomb			KEY:Mudman ~ Mud Bomb	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A mudman can hurl globs of its muddy body mixed with its surrounding mud-this attack has a range increment of 10 feet. If one of these mud bombs hits a target, it quickly grows semi-solid and tenacious, causing 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. If the cumulative Dexterity damage from mud bombs ever equals the target's actual Dexterity score, the target remains conscious but is held immobile and cannot take any physical action (although see below) until the mud is removed or the target breaks free. Spell-like abilities or spells with only verbal components may be used if the trapped creature can make a DC 20 concentration check. It's a DC 20 Strength check (made as a full-round action) to pry accumulated mud off and remove all Dexterity damage caused by the attack-a creature that is held immobile can break free with a DC 25 Strength check made as a full-round action (this is the only physical action the creature can attempt while encased in mud). The mud dries and crumbles to dust in 15 minutes, or in 1d3 rounds if a large amount of water (such as results from a casting of create water) is used to wash it away.
Mud Pool			KEY:Mudman ~ Mud Pool	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A mudman cannot leave the bounds of the mud pool it dwells in, although these mud pools may be of any size. A mudman's tremorsense extends throughout the entire mud pool, and it gains a +16 bonus on Stealth checks when hiding in a mud pool. A mudman forced out of its mud pool is staggered.
Magic Weapons		KEY:Magic Weapons ~ Mudman	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MudmanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A mudman's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

### Mummy Golem

Racial Abilities	KEY:MummyGolem ~ Racial Abilities		CATEGORY:Internal	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE:MummyGolemRaceAbility
Strangulation	KEY:MummyGolem ~ Strangulation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MummyGolemRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:As a standard action a mummy golem can attempt to wrap bandages from its body around a grappled foe's throat. The mummy golem makes a grapple check. If the mummy golem wins the check, it slips seve bandages around the foe's throat deals 1d4 points of strangulation damage in addition to constriction damage. The bandages can come from anywhere on its body, not just its arm or hand. Therefore, a mummy golem can continue to use its slam attacks, constriction, and strangulation attack against other foes. A Medium mummy golem can strangle a maximum of 4 opponents at one time using this ability. A Large mummy golem can strangle a maximum of 6 opponents at one time using this ability. A mummy golem is not considered grappled while it is strangling an opponent, and can move and attack normally, but it cannot move more than 10 feet away from an opponent while strangling it.

### Mummy of the Deep

Racial Abilities	KEY:MummyoftheDeep ~ Racial Abilities		CATEGORY:Internal	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE:MummyoftheDeepRaceAbility
Control Water	KEY:MummyoftheDeep ~ Control Water	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MummyoftheDeepRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Once per day, a mummy of the deep can control water (as the spell, caster level 8th).
Curse of the Deep	KEY:MummyoftheDeep ~ Curse of the Deep	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MummyoftheDeepRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:On a successful grapple check against a creature up to its size, a mummy of the deep presses its lips against an opponent's and regurgitates sea water into the opponent's lungs.  Each round thereafter, for the next 10 rounds, the victim must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of damage that round. Three consecutive successful saves means the character has coughed up enough water to shake the effects of this attack and takes no further damage. An affected creature can take no actions other than to defend itself in any round it takes damage from this ability. At 0 or less hit points, the victim falls unconscious. In the next round, he drowns. The save DC is Charisma-based.  Holding one's breath does not prevent drowning (water is already in the lungs). A remove curse, heal spell, or successful DC 20 Heal check halts the damage if applied before the creature reaches 0 or less hit points.
Despair		KEY:MummyoftheDeep ~ Despair	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MummyoftheDeepRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At the mere sight of a mummy of the deep, the viewer must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by that mummy of the deep's despair ability for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Death Throes	KEY:MurderCrow ~ Death Throes	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MurderCrowRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:If a murder crow is reduced to 0 hit points or less, it explodes into a murder of standard crows. Use the statistics for the undead raven swarm found elsewhere in this book. These smaller crows continue to relentlessly attack all living creatures within sight.
Eye Rake		KEY:MurderCrow ~ Eye Rake	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MurderCrowRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:If a murder crow hits an opponent with both claws in the same round, the victim must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or be blinded as the crow scratches and tears at the victim's eyes. The blindness last for 1d4 days while the eyes naturally heal, or until healed (with remove blindness or a successful DC 15 Heal check). The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.

Despondent Wail	KEY:MurderBorn ~ Despondent Wail	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MurderBornRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:As a standard action, a murder-born can unleash a child-like wail. Any living creature within 60 feet that hears the wail must make a successful DC 16 Will save or be overcome with supernatural feelings of hopelessness. A powerful curse falls upon the victim and they become so despondent that they need to make a successful DC 16 Concentration check in order to motivate themselves enough to make an attack or cast spell. The curse is permanent, though a remove curse or break enchantment (both requiring a successful caster level check against DC 18) or a limited wish, wish, or miracle can remove the effects of curse. The save DC is Charisma-based. Whether or not the save is successful, an individual cannot be affected by a murderborn's despondent wail for the next 24 hours.
Sense Living	KEY:MurderBorn ~ Sense Living	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MurderBornRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A murder-born can detect living creatures to a range of 100 feet.

There is no chance the murder-born to be stunned and it is not blocked by stone, wood, or any other material.

Poison Aura		KEY:MustardJelly ~ Poison Aura	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:MustardJellyRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The mustard jelly exudes an aura of poison in a 10-foot radius centered on it that slows (as the slow spell) any creature in the area as long as it remains in the area and for 1d4 rounds afterward if it fails a DC 21 Fortitude save. A new save must be made each round a creature is within 10 feet of the mustard jelly. The save DC is Constitution-based.

This transports the nabasu and up to six other creatures provided they all link hands with the nabasu.

Rejuvenation		KEY:Poltergeist ~ Rejuvenation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PoltergeistRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Like ghosts, it's difficult to destroy a poltergeist through simple combat: the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Unlike ghosts, powerful spells such as dispel evil usually are effective. Short of that, however, the only way to permanently destroy a poltergeist is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different poltergeist or group of poltergeists by the GM.

Undead and negative energy based creatures within the area take %2d8 points of positive energy damage. Positive energy based creatures (including creatures from the Material plane) gain hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise dealt. (The rules for temporary hit points and doubling hit points as detailed under the elemental's positive energy apply here.) A successful Reflex save (DC %3) reduces the damage by half.|PositiveEnergyElementalRadius|PositiveEnergyElementalDamage|PositiveEnergyElementalDC
Positive Energy			KEY:PositiveEnergyElementalSmall ~ Positive Energy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PositiveEnergyElementalSmallRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A positive energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with positive energy.

Such creatures can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1 minute later.  Creatures healed to twice their normal hit points (that is, a creature whose hit points are effectively doubled) must succeed on a (DC %1) Fortitude save or explode in a burst of positive energy.

Positive Energy Aura		KEY:PositiveEnergyElementalSmall ~ Positive Energy Aura	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PositiveEnergyElementalSmallRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A positive energy elemental radiates an aura of pure positive energy in a %1-ft. radius around it.  Within a positive energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use positive energy, such as positive energy channeling or the Turn Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels higher.  Additionally, spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy are maximized (as if the Maximize Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but the spells don't require higher-level slots).

The stench is highly potent, and short of magical means of cleaning, all cloth and such material continue to reek for 1d6 months. The odor is so strong that it doubles all chances for random encounters and imposes a -6 penalty on Stealth checks attempted while wearing clothing contaminated with a skunk's musk. Flesh, leather goods, metal goods (weapons, armor, and the like) must be washed in a concentrated mixture of vinegar over period of 1d3 days.

If a stunjelly remains in contact with a wooden object for 1 full round, it inflicts 18 points of damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Camouflage		KEY:StunJelly ~ Camouflage	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:StunJellyRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Since a stunjelly looks like normal stone when at rest, it takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (dungeoneering) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the stunjelly. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice a stunjelly.
Corrosion		KEY:StunJelly ~ Corrosion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:StunJellyRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:An opponent that is being engulfed by a stunjelly suffers a -4 penalty on Reflex saves made to resist acid damage applying to clothing and armor.

Alien Thoughts	KEY:Tshann ~ Alien Thoughts	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TshannRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The alien brainwaves of a t'shann have a bizarre effect on intelligent creatures. Within 30 feet of a t'shann, all opponents with an Intelligence score greater than 5 must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be affected as if by a confusion spell (caster level equal to the t'shann's HD). If the opponent approaches to within 10 feet he must succeed on another DC 13 Will save or take 1d4 points of Intelligence damage for as long as he remains within 10 feet of the t'shann. Once the opponent moves more than 10 feet from this effect, his Intelligence score immediately returns to normal, although any confusion effects remain until he moves more than 30 feet away. Psionic monsters and creatures, being attuned to the brainwaves of others, suffer these effects at double the normal range. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Burrow		KEY:Tshann ~ Burrow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TshannRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A t'shann rarely appears in the open air, preferring the closeness and coolness of being deep in the earth. In order to attack a t'shann physically, an opponent must first find it and lure it out of its burrow. Finding a t'shann burrow requires a successful DC 15 Perception check.  Once the burrow is located, the t'shann can be lured out by placing small pile of gems at the entrance. The t'shann must succeed on a DC 10 Will save or shuffle out of its lair to consume the treats.
Spew			KEY:Tshann ~ Spew	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TshannRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:If attacked, a t'shann emits a spray of powerful acids from nearly every pore on its body, affecting any creature within 10 feet of it. This acidic spray deals 1d4 points of acid damage, plus 1 point of damage per round for 1d4 rounds. A DC 13 Reflex save reduces the acid damage by half. The save DC is Constitution based.

Chemisorb (Ex) A tallow golem can break down and absorb chemicals from a living victim by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round the pin is maintained.  Additionally, this causes skin discoloration.  The victim must make a successful DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Charisma drain. Whether the save succeeds or fails, that victim cannot be affected again by the skin discoloration of that tallow golem's chemisorb attack for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

AAA	KEY:Tangtal ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TangtalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Duplicate (Su) As a standard action, a tangtal can create an effect similar to a mirror image spell (caster level 12th).  This allows the tangtal to create up to eight images of itself. The images can move up to 30 feet away from the tangtal, but each must be within 10 feet of another image. The tangtal can use this ability once per day and it otherwise resembles the mirror image spell.

Tarry Demodand

AAA	KEY:TarryDemodand ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TarryDemodandRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Adhesive (Ex) A tarry demodand exudes a thick tar-like substance that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items touching it. A tarry demodand has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks due to its tarry secretions in addition to that provided by its grab ability.  A weapon that strikes a tarry demodand is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 19 Reflex save. A successful DC 19 Strength check is needed to pry it off. The save DC and check DC are Constitution-based.  Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive. A pint of wine or a similar liquid weakens it, but the tarry demodand can still grapple normally. A tarry demodand can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 1 minute after the creature dies.

AAA	KEY:TarryDemodand ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TarryDemodandRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Rage (Ex) A tarry demodand that takes damage in combat has a 50% chance of flying into a berserk rage the following round, clawing and biting madly until either it or its opponent is dead. It gains +4 Strength and -4 AC. The creature cannot end its rage voluntarily.  While raging, make the following adjustments to the tarry demodand's statistics: AC 23, touch 11, flat-footed 18; CMB +20 (+28 grapple); CMD 35; Melee 2 claws +21 melee (1d6+9), bite +20 melee (1d8+9); Str 28

AAA	KEY:Tazelwurm ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TazelwurmRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Frightening Exuviation (Ex) If a tazelwurm is hit by a fire attack or effect that deals at least 10 points of damage, it takes no damage, but instead allows its scales, flesh, and fur to be consumed and burned away in a single round, exposing its skeletal structure. A creature viewing this must make a successful DC 15 Will save or paralyzed with fear for 1d3 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same tazelwurm's frightening exuviation for one day. This has no effect on other tazelwurms.

Temporal Crawler

AAA	KEY:TemporalCrawler ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TemporalCrawlerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Slowing Webs (Ex) The web of a temporal crawler emanates a slow effect (as the slow spell, caster level 6th) that affects all creatures within 10 feet of the web. Affected creatures can make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save the round they are affected to negate the effects.  Creatures are slowed as long as they stay within 10 feet of a web. The slow effects can be counterspelled with the successful casting of a haste spell if the caster makes a successful caster level check (DC 16) before casting the haste spell. The save DC is Constitution-based.  A temporal crawler can fire a web up to four times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets up to one size category larger than the temporal crawler.  An entangled creature can attempt a DC 19 Escape Artist check or burst it with a DC 19 Strength check. Both are standard actions. The check DCs are both Constitution-based and the Strength check DC includes a +4 racial bonus.  Temporal crawlers often create sticky sheets of webbing up to 20 feet square. Approaching creatures must make a successful DC 20 Perception check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot section has 10 hit points, and sheet webs have damage reduction 5/ magic.

AAA	KEY:TemporalCrawler ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TemporalCrawlerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Foresight (Su) A temporal crawler can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents a temporal crawler from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants the temporal crawler an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but the temporal crawler can restart it as a free action on its next turn.

Tentacled Horror

AAA	KEY:TentacledHorror ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TentacledHorrorRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Aura of Insanity (Su) Creatures with less than 6 HD that view a tentacled horror must make a DC 23 Will save or be affected as if by an insanity spell (caster level 12th). Creatures of 2 HD or less are not only driven mad but are also compelled to worship the tentacled horror as a god (as if affected by a charm person spell, caster level 12th). Only a restoration, greater restoration, miracle, or wish spell can restore the mind of one driven insane by a tentacled horror. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes +2 for its Ability Focus feat.

AAA	KEY:TentacledHorror ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TentacledHorrorRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Horn (Su) The source of a tentacled horror's power is its horn. If a tentacled horror's horn is removed, it loses its regeneration ability and suffers a -6 penalty to Strength and Constitution until the horn is reattached. The horn is AC 20, hardness 10, and has 20 hit points. A tentacled horror's horn cannot be removed unless it is helpless. It takes a successful DC 40 Strength or 10 points of damage to the horn to remove a tentacled horror's horn.

Tentamort

AAA	KEY:Tentamort ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TentamortRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Paralysis (Ex) The digestive fluid injected by a tentamort's stinging tentacle is coupled with a paralytic poison as well that forces the victim to make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for one minute. Immunity to poison negates this effect.

AAA	KEY:Tentamort ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TentamortRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Liquefy Organs (Ex) A tentamort can insert the needlelike projection from its stinging tentacle into the body of a foe grappled by either tentacle. Doing so requires a successful melee attack, and the tentamort cannot insert the projection into a creature grappled with its constricting tentacle if its stinging tentacle is also grappling a foe.  Once inserted, the tentamort injects a digestive liquid and a paralytic poison (see above) through the hollow barb that liquefies the victim's internal organs; the tentamort draws this liquefied slurry back through the hollow needle into its own body to feed. This attack deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round the tube remains inserted in a foe.  Once the needle is removed or the tentamort is killed, the foe continues to take 1 point of Constitution damage until it succeeds at a DC 13 Fortitude save. This Constitution damage can be halted by spells or effects that remove disease or heal ability score damage (including lesser restoration).

The Oinodaemon Daemon

AAA	KEY:TheOinodaemon ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TheOinodaemonRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Disease (Ex) Daemonic Plague: Slam-injury; save Fort DC 47, onset 1 day; frequency 1/ day; effect 2d6 Con damage; cure 3 consecutive saves.  Each time the victim takes Con damage, it must succeed on a second Fort save or lose 2 points of the Con damage permanently. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:TheOinodaemon ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TheOinodaemonRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Transfixing Gaze (Su) A living creature within 30 feet that meets the Oinodaemon's gaze must succeed on a DC 46 Will save, or be held (as the hold person spell, CL 37th). An affected creature can attempt a new save each round to break the effects if it has 24 HD or more; otherwise, only the Oinodaemon can release it, or a wish or miracle can break the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. If the Oinodaemon is slain or moves more than 30 feet away from a held creature, it is automatically released. The Oinodaemon only has to remain within range to maintain this ability; he does not have to concentrate.

Staff of the Lower Planes () This 12-foot long, black wooden staff can only be wielded by the current Oinodaemon or any daemon he allows to wield it. In anyone else's hands, the staff functions as a normal quarterstaff. Upon the current Oinodaemon's death, the staff can be wielded (and it functions as detailed below) by the new Oinodaemon. The staff has the powers listed below. All powers function as the

spell of the same name (CL 25th or the wielder's caster level, whichever is higher). Save DCs are 20 + spell level.
- Doom, fear (1 charge)
- Dominate monster, geas/quest, mass charm monster, unholy aura (2 charges)
- Once per day, wish (grant another's wish) (2 charges)

The staff has an unlimited number of charges, but no more than 50 charges may be expended in a single day.

The staff's powers automatically overcome any other daemon's spell resistance. Any non-daemon that touches the staff takes 10d8 points of electricity damage per round of contact (no save) and gains two negative levels each round it touches the staff. The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 35 and can result in actual level loss on a failed save.

Time Elemental

AAA	KEY:TimeElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Alter Age (Su) Once per day, a noble time elemental can age a creature simply by touching it (this requires a melee touch attack). If successful, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or advance forward one aging step (from adulthood to middle age, from middle age to old, from old to venerable, and so on). If a character ages, he takes all the effects to his physical ability scores, but does not gain any of the bonuses to his mental ability scores. A venerable creature affected by this ability dies (from massive cell death) and cannot be restored to life by mortal magic. The save DC is Constitution-based.  Alternately, a time elemental can use its alter age ability to reduce a character's age. If the target is unwilling, the time elemental must succeed on a melee touch attack.  An unwilling target can make a Fortitude save to avoid the effects. If the save fails, the target ages one age step backwards (from middle age to adulthood for example) and gains all bonuses to physical ability scores from his new age (simply flip the penalties listed on the aging table into an equal numbered bonus). A character that regresses in age does not reduce its mental ability scores. This ability does not affect a character that has died from old age.  A time elemental can also use this ability to age vegetable matter 10-200 years (older or younger) or mineral matter 100-2,000 years (older or younger).  Royal time elementals can use this ability twice per day.

AAA	KEY:TimeElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Cell Death (Ex) Damage dealt by a time elemental's slam attack does not heal naturally (but it can still be healed magically). Additionally, a creature slain by a time elemental can only be raised through the successful casting of a miracle, true resurrection, or wish spell.

AAA	KEY:TimeElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Foresight (Su) A time elemental can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents it from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants the time elemental an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but the time elemental can restart it as a free action on its next turn.  Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex) Time elementals are immune to all time-related spells and effects (including time stop, temporal stasis, and the like). Note, the time stop ability of the noble and royal time elementals can affect those time elementals of lesser power (i.e., a noble can affect a common and a royal can affect a noble or common).

AAA	KEY:TimeElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Multi-Manifestation (Su) A time elemental exists in several other dimensions at any given time. As a standard action, it can bring forth 1d4 of these manifestations to its current locale in order to gain multiple attacks that round. Treat each manifestation as a separate time elemental with hit points equal to the time elemental's current hit points. A manifestation cannot use any of the supernatural or spelllike abilities of the time elemental (a manifestation does however gain the time elemental's foresight ability). A time elemental cannot have more than four manifestations present at one time.  Because each manifestation is a part of the time elemental that called them, a successful attack on the time elemental or any of its manifestations deals an equal amount of damage to them all.

AAA	KEY:TimeElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:
Summon Time Elementals (Sp) Once per day, a royal time elemental can attempt to summon 1d4 common time elementals with a 70% chance of success or 1-2 noble time elementals with a 30% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell.

AAA	KEY:TimeElemental ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeElementalRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Temporal Displacement (Su) By making a melee touch attack against a foe, a noble or royal time elemental can remove that creature from the current time stream if it fails a Fortitude save. The save is Constitution-based.  On a failed save, the creature disappears in a flash of white energy. For a number of minutes equal to the time elemental's Hit Dice, the displaced creature is effectively nonexistent. No form of magic, effect, or force can detect or aid such a creature. A displaced creature can attempt a Wisdom check (DC equal to the initial Fort DC) on its turn to break the effects and end the displacement. The save is Constitution-based.  When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the same space it was in before being displaced. If the space is occupied when the creature returns, it is shunted aside to the first open space and takes no damage. A noble or royal time elemental can use this ability three times per day.  Time Jaunt (Su) A time elemental can slip through the time stream and appear anywhere on the same plane of existence as if by greater teleport. This ability transports the time elemental and up to four other creatures within a 30-foot radius. Unwilling creatures can attempt a Will save to avoid being carried away. This ability is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (caster level equal to the elemental's HD). The save DC is Constitution-based.  Time Stop (Sp) Noble and royal time elementals can create an effect identical to a time stop spell once per day (caster level equals the time elemental's HD).

Time Flayer

AAA	KEY:TimeFlayer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeFlayerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Foresight (Su) A time flayer can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents a time flayer from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants the time flayer an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but the time flayer can restart it as a free action on its next turn.

AAA	KEY:TimeFlayer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeFlayerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex) Time flayers are immune to all time-related spells and effects (including time stop, temporal stasis, and the like).

AAA	KEY:TimeFlayer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeFlayerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Reality Bend (Su) As a free action, a time flayer can fold the dimensional space surrounding it so its true location is hard to discern. Attackers have a 50% miss chance each time they attack with melee or ranged weapons. This is similar to the miss chance granted by a displacement spell. See invisibility does not reveal the creature's location, but true seeing does.

AAA	KEY:TimeFlayer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeFlayerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Temporal Displacement (Su) As a melee touch attack, a time flayer can send a creature a few seconds into the future. A DC 18 Fortitude save negates. The save is Constitution-based.  On a failed save, the creature disappears in a flash of white energy only to reappear in the same space 1d4 rounds later. This effectively removes that creature from combat for the duration. If the space is occupied when the creature returns, it suffers no damage and is shunted aside. The time flayer can use this ability three times per day.

AAA	KEY:TimeFlayer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeFlayerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Time Jaunt (Su) As a standard action, a time flayer can slip through the time stream and appear anywhere on the same plane of existence as if by greater teleport. This ability transports the time flayer and up to four other creatures within a 30-foot radius that the time flayer designates.  Unwilling creatures can attempt a DC 18 Will save to avoid being carried away. This ability is otherwise similar to the greater teleport spell. The save DC is Constitution-based.

AAA	KEY:TimeFlayer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TimeFlayerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Unmaking (Su) An opponent slain by a time flayer is unmade-erased from the very fabric of time. No memories or recollections of the unmade creature exist anywhere in reality. Past events the creature was responsible for are now attributed to an unknown-even if they recently took place. For example, suppose a great hero saved a kingdom from certain doom and then suffers the unmaking. The kingdom is still safe, but no one can quite recall who saved it.  A creature that suffers the unmaking cannot be raised, resurrected, or restored to life by any means-not even a wish can restore an unmade creature. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore one who suffers this fate.

AAA	KEY:TombstoneFairy ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TombstoneFairyRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Danse Macabre (Su) Once per night, a tombstone fairy can invoke a ritual to raise any evil creature from the dead. The ritual takes 10 minutes to perform and the target cannot have been dead longer than one day per HD of the tombstone fairy. Additionally, the target's body must be present during the ritual and its soul must be available for return (that is, if the target's soul is trapped, such as by a trap the soul spell, this ritual automatically fails).  A target unwilling to return to life can prevent its raising by making an opposed Charisma check against the tombstone fairy's Charisma check. If the tombstone fairy wins the check, the target's soul is forced into its body a it returns to life. If the target wins the opposed check, it prevents its raising, and the tombstone fairy cannot atte to raise that same target for one month.  During the ritual a portion of the target's soul transfers to funeral shroud or cloth. The tombstone fairy often retains shroud so as to force compliance from the returned tar Once the target does what the fairy desires, the tombst fairy finishes this ritual and transfers the last bit of the targ soul from the shroud into its body. If the funeral shroud is destroyed while it contains a part of the target's soul, the target instantly dies and can only be returned to life through the use of a resurrection, true resurrection, miracle or wish.  This ability otherwise resembles a raise dead spell.  A tombstone fairy can have only one funeral shroud (containing a target's soul) in its possession at one time.

Ghost Touch (Ex) A tormentor devil deals damage normally with its claws against incorporeal creatures.

AAA	KEY:TormentorDevil ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TormentorDevilRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Soul Track (Su) A tormentor devil can track the soul of any creature that enters any of the planes of Hell. Tracking a soul has a base DC of 20 and follows the rules for tracking.  A tormentor devil must be on the same plane as the soul it is tracking.

AAA	KEY:TormentorDevil ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TormentorDevilRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:
Soulcatcher Net () A tormentor devil's net looks like a normal net and follows the rules for net attacks. The net has 20 hit points; the Escape Artist check to get free is DC 30; the net can be broken with a successful DC 30 Strength check. The net can entrap incorporeal creatures.  The net has many small razor-sharp barbs lining it. These barbs deal 1d6 points of damage each round to any creature caught in the net, including incorporeal creatures. (The incorporeal creature's 50% chance to avoid damage from a corporeal source does not apply to this attack.)

Transposer

AAA	KEY:Transposer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TransposerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Blending Disguise (Ex) When using its disguise self spell-like ability, the transposer can make itself look like a creature of the humanoid or monstrous humanoid type. When disguising itself, the transposer ignores the usual penalty for different race, age category, and gender. Finally, transposers gain a racial bonus equal to one half their racial Hit Dice to the Will save DC to penetrate the illusion of their disguise self ability.

AAA	KEY:Transposer ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TransposerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Transposition (Su) An opponent hit by a transposer's slam attack becomes linked (transposed) to it by an invisible and undetectable field of energy for 1 hour if it fails a DC 14 Fortitude save. A transposer can have a number of opponents equal to its HD linked to it at one time. An opponent can be linked to more than one transposer (if it fails its save against each transposer's attack). The save DC is Constitution-based.  When a linked opponent attacks a transposer it is linked to, the creature gains hit points equal to the damage the attack would normally deal, and the attacker takes the damage. Other opponents linked to that transposer are unharmed. A transposer can gain up to the maximum hit points allowed by its Hit Dice. It cannot gain bonus or temporary hit points from this ability.  Curative magic cast on a transposer by a transposed opponent damages the creature by the amount it would normally heal, and heals a like amount of damage on the one who cast the spell. (Other linked creatures are unaffected.) Curative magic cast on a transposed opponent works normally but does not heal or harm a linked transposer. Curative magic cast on a transposer by a non-linked opponent functions normally.  Opponents not linked to the transposer can attack and affect the creature normally.

Smother (Ex) A trapper can try to wrap a creature up to one size smaller than itself in its body as a standard action.  The trapper attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and deals buffet damage each round the hold is maintained. Further, a grappled opponent must hold its breath or suffocate. Attacks that hit a smothering trapper deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.

Tri-Flower Frond

AAA	KEY:TriFlowerFrond ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TriFlowerFrondRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Acid (Ex) The tri-flower frond can tip its yellow bloom over a slumbering or prone foe and shower it with sap laden with potent digestive enzymes. This sap does 1d6 points of acid damage per round to flesh until it is washed or scraped off.

AAA	KEY:TriFlowerFrond ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TriFlowerFrondRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Camouflage (Ex) Since a tri-flower frond looks like a normal flowering plant when at rest, it takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant.

AAA	KEY:TriFlowerFrond ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TriFlowerFrondRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Fluid Drain (Ex) Against a sleeping or helpless foe, a tri-flower frond can release a needle-sharp tendril from its red bloom that pierces its target and drains its body fluids. This deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round, and the victim is considered grappled.

AAA	KEY:TriFlowerFrond ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TriFlowerFrondRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Sleep Pollen (Ex) A creature struck by one of the tri-flower frond's tendrils must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or fall into a deep, coma-like slumber from which it cannot be awakened that lasts for 1-4 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based. Resistances and immunities to poison apply against the pollen, but resistances or immunities to sleep effects do not. A slumbering victim can also be awakened by a successful DC 20 Heal check after one minute of treatment.  A creature that falls victim to the sleep pollen is subject to the tri-flower frond's acid and fluid drain attacks, both as free actions.

Troblin

AAA	KEY:Troblin ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TroblinRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Mutation (Ex) The regenerative ability of a troblin does not function as well as those of its trollish parent. Sometimes when an injured troblin regenerates, its body warps in an inexplicable fashion. A severed arm may regrow as two arms, or a scar may grow to cover the troblin's entire body in thick skin. Further, if a troblin suffers a critical hit in melee, it has a 25% chance of gaining a mutation once it is fully healed. See the sidebar for random mutations.

Troblin Mutations

Each troblin has the potential to possess 1d2 random mutations brought about by its bizarre regeneration. Roll on the table below for each mutation.

AAA	KEY:Tumblespark ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TumblesparkRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Insubstantial Form (Ex) A tumblespark's natural form is a ball of dancing and arcing electricity; it is not solid, nor is it incorporeal. Any piercing or slashing attack has a 20% miss chance against a tumblespark. Bludgeoning attacks deal damage normally.

Tsathar

AAA	KEY:Tsathar ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TsatharRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Implant (Ex) Tsathar are sexless, reproducing by injecting eggs into living hosts. An egg can be implanted only into a helpless host creature. The host must be of Small size or larger. Giant frogs, bred for this very purpose, are the most common host. Implanting an egg requires one minute to perform.  Accompanying the egg is an anaesthetizing poison that causes the host to fall unconscious for the two-week gestation period of the egg unless the host succeeds on a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw; this save DC includes a +8 racial bonus. If the save succeeds, the host remains conscious, but is violently ill (-10 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks) 24 hours before the eggs hatch. When the eggs mature, the young tsathar emerges from the host, killing it in the process.  A remove disease spell rids the victim any implanted eggs. A DC 20 Heal check can be attempted to surgically extract an egg from a host. If the check fails, the healer can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d6 points of damage to the patient.

AAA	KEY:Tsathar ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TsatharRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Leap (Ex) Tsathar are incredible jumpers, able to leap up to 30 feet horizontally or 10 feet vertically. They have a +14 racial bonus on horizontal jumps, or +24 on vertical jumps, and they do not need to make a 10-foot minimum running start before jumping to avoid doubling the jumping DCs. Tsathar can always take 10 when making an Acrobatics check to jump.  When a tsathar begins its round by jumping next to an opponent it can make a full attack in the same round. A tsathar wearing medium or heavy armor or carrying a medium or heavy load cannot use this ability.

AAA	KEY:Tsathar ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TsatharRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:
Summon Hydrodaemon (Sp) A tsathar with at least five levels of cleric can, once per day, attempt to summon a hydrodaemon (q.v.) with a 40% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.

AAA	KEY:Tsathar ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TsatharRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Slimy (Ex) Because tsathar continuously cover themselves with muck and slime, they are difficult to grapple. Webs, magic or otherwise, do not affect tsathar, and they usually can wriggle free from most other forms of confinement.  This grants them a +12 racial bonus to their CMD to escape grapples, and to their Escape Artist checks.

Tsathogga

AAA	KEY:Tsathogga ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TsathoggaRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Acidic Hide (Ex) Tsathogga's demonic form constantly oozes and drips acid. Creatures attacking Tsathogga unarmed or with natural weapons take 2d8 points of acid damage each time one of their attacks hits. Any weapon striking Tsathogga's acidic body likewise takes acid damage.

AAA	KEY:Tsathogga ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TsathoggaRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Blasphemous Croak (Su) Three times per day, Tsathogga can unleash a piercing croak that affects all non-evil creatures within a 100-foot radius as if by a blasphemy spell (CL 20th). There is no save against the effects.

AAA	KEY:Tsathogga ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TsathoggaRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:
Seeping Darkness (Su) As a free action, Tsathogga can billow forth a cloud of thick, dark fog from his skin. This fog spreads to fill a 50-foot radius, 50 feet high. The darkness generated by the cloud nullifies nonmagical lights and magical lights of 5th level or lower within the area.  Furthermore, all creatures in the area gain concealment, including those that can normally see in such darkness, tough Tsathogga is able to see normally in it. Light descriptor spells of 5th level or lower (such as daylight, dancing lights, and light) are incapable of brightening the area.  This cloud remains for 10 minutes before dispersing. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds; a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round. Tsathogga cannot use this ability underwater. Once the cloud disperses, Tsathogga can issue a new one if he desires.

The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category larger than the turtle-shark's size, it takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.

AAA	KEY:TurtleShark ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:TurtleSharkRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

Ubue

AAA	KEY:Ubue ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:UbueRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Multiple Personalities (Ex) The three heads of an ubue rarely get along with each other. Due to this division of personalities, there is a 15% chance in any given situation (usually once per encounter) that the heads get into an argument. An ubue engaged in an argument with itself takes a -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, Reflex saves, and to AC for the duration of the encounter, or until they can reach some sort of accord.  In a non-combat situation, an opponent can coerce an ubue into a self-argument by making a Charisma check opposed by the ubue's Wisdom check. If the ubue wins the opposed check, the character cannot attempt to coerce that ubue again for one day.

AAA	KEY:Ubue ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:UbueRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

Attach (Ex) When a volt hits with bite, it latches onto the opponent's body, anchoring it in place. An attached volt is effectively grappling its prey. The volt loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 13, but holds on with great tenacity and inserts its proboscis into the grappled target's flesh. A volt has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached.

An opponent struck by a blob of vorin poison spit at them is protected from its effects for a short time by any amount of worn armor-the blob strikes the armor but not the opponent's flesh. The blob of poison seeps through armor in a number of rounds equal to the armor's armor bonus (do not apply any magical bonuses). The blob can be scraped off as a move action. Natural armor does not provide any defense as the poison seeps through the opponent's pores, nor does poison delivered by a vorin's sting have the same delayed effect.

AAA	KEY:Vorin ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VorinRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:

Intelligence Damage (Ex) As a free action, a yellow musk creeper can insert hundreds of tiny roots into the head of an entranced foe within any space occupied by the creeper. An entranced foe does not resist this attack and does not receive a saving throw to break free of its entranced state. This attack deals 1d4 points of Intelligence damage each round.  A victim reduced to Intelligence 0 becomes a yellow musk zombie in 1 hour (see Appendix B).

AAA	KEY:YellowMuskCreeper ~ AAA	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:YellowMuskCreeperRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:
Pollen Spray (Ex) A yellow musk creeper can spray a tiny cloud of hypnotic pollen at a single creature within 30 feet. An opponent hit by the cloud must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or be entranced for 1d4 minutes (as by a charm monster spell). Entranced creatures can take no action other than to move at their normal speed into a space occupied by the yellow musk creeper. An entranced creature resists any attempt to halt its progress. A victim within a space occupied by the yellow musk creeper stands there and offers no resistance to the monster's attacks. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Rejuvenation (Ex) A yellow musk creeper can be killed only if its root is dug up, then burned, hacked apart, or otherwise
destroyed. Reducing the creeper to 0 or less hit points puts it out of commission, allowing excavation of its roots. The main root is a Small object with a hardness of 3 and 10 hit points. The root can be affected by spells or effects that affect an area or targeted by spells that affect an individual target.  As long as the root remains intact, a yellow musk creeper regrows in about 2 weeks.

Frightful Gaze (Su) Creatures within 30 feet that meet the eyes of a yeti must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or stand paralyzed in fear (treat as a hold person spell) for 3 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. An affected creature does not receive a saving throw each round to break the effects. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the frightful gaze of that yeti for one day.
