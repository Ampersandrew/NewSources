Debilitating Constriction	KEY:Abyssal Harvester ~ Debilitating Constriction	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbyssalHarvesterRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.14		DESC:An abyssal harvester that has successfully grappled an opponent of its size or smaller deals tentacle damage plus 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round the hold is maintained. A creature reduced to Constitution 0 by an abyssal harvester dies. Note, that the abyssal harvester only deals Constitution damage when constricting a foe.
Far Reaching			KEY:Abyssal Harvester ~ Far Reaching			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbyssalHarvesterRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.14		DESC:An abyssal harvester can remain on its abyssal plane and inject up to four of its tentacles across the dimensions and into the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, material planes, or Nine Hells. It can do this a total of twelve times per day (so it could inject one tentacle twelve times into any plane, or four tentacles up to three times each).  All of its tentacles must be injected into the same plane, and all appear within the same 20-foot area. While using this abitliy, it uses sensory organs on its tentacles to see, hear, smell, and feel its surroundings. It can attack normally (at its full attack bonus) while using this ability but it cannot move from its current location. It can withdraw its tentacles as a move action and re-inject them into the same plane (or a different plane) on its next turn.  A dismissal, dispel chaos, or dispel evil spell (using the second effect of either spell) causes an abyssal harvester to withdraw a single tentacle (whichever one was touched) if it fails its Will save.  It cannot re-inject that same tentacle into the same plane for one day.  A banishment spell forces an abyssal harvester to withdraw all of its tentacles if it fails its Will save. It cannot re-inject any tentacles that were banished into the same plane for one day.
Harvest				KEY:Abyssal Harvester ~ Harvest				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbyssalHarvesterRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.14		DESC:This ability can only be used when the abyssal harvester is on its abyssal plane and injects its tentacles into the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, a material plane, or the Nine Hells.  A grappled foe with 20 or fewer hit points or 4 or fewer Constitution points must succeed on a DC 21 Will save or be drawn through an invisible planar gate (created around the abyssal harvester's tentacles) onto the same plane where the abyssal harvester currently resides. An opponent drawn into the same plane with the harvester is still grappled upon arrival. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Tentacle Regeneration		KEY:Abyssal Harvester ~ Tentacle Regeneration		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbyssalHarvesterRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.14		DESC:An abyssal harvester regrows any lost tentacles in 1 week.

A weapon that strikes an adherer is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC %1 Reflex save. A successful DC %1 Strength check is needed to pry it off.  The save and check DC are both Constitution-based.  An application of boiling water thrown on the adherer deals 1d4 points of damage to it (and to any creature stuck to it). It also reduces both the Reflex save DC and the Strength check DC to 10 for 1 round. An application of fire deals damage to both the adherer and any creature stuck to it and weakens the adhesive (as above) for 1d3 rounds.

Bump in the Night		KEY:Bogeyman ~ Bump in the Night	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BogeymanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A bogeyman can create a phantasmagoric image in the mind of a single creature within 200 feet. Such images cause the victim to see and hear things that are not really there or to see and hear things differently than they actually are. Things such as following footsteps, bumps and thumps from an unknown source, a gnarled tree with outstretched limbs scratching on a window or reaching for someone, the idea that someone or something is lurking around the corner, in the closet, or under the bed, and so on. A creature affected by the images takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage if it fails a DC 19 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus from the bogeyman's Ability Focus feat. The bogeyman can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. A creature who drops to Wisdom 0 is affected as if by an insanity spell (caster level 8th) until at least 1 point of Wisdom is restored.
Frighten			KEY:Bogeyman ~ Frighten	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BogeymanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A living creature within 60 feet that views a bogeyman must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or stand frozen in fear for 1d6+2 rounds. Such a creature is not helpless, but cannot take any action. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same bogeyman's frighten ability for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Shadow Shift			KEY:Bogeyman ~ Shadow Shift	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BogeymanRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A bogeyman has the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a dimension door spell.

A bogeyman can shift up to a total of 80 feet each day in this way; this may be a single jump of 80 feet or multiple jumps of 10 feet each. This amount can be split among many jumps, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment.

### Boggart

Racial Abilities		KEY:Boggart ~ Racial Abilities		CATEGORY:Internal	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility
Change Shape			KEY:Boggart ~ Change Shape	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A boggart's natural form is that of a small humanoid (resembling a young gnome, halfling, or goblin). It has one other form: that of a small, immature will-o'-wisp. In humanoid form, a boggart assumes the same appearance and traits of its form, much as a lycanthrope would. In humanoid form, a boggart retains all of its special attacks and special qualities. The second form is that of a will-o- 'wisp. In this form, a boggart is nearly indistinguishable from a normal willo'-wisp, but a DC 18 Knowledge (dungeoneering) or Perception check reveals that the boggart is in fact smaller and brighter. A boggart can assume either form as a standard action, though it cannot maintain either one for longer than 1 minute (10 rounds). A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the boggart revert to its true natural form when slain. A true seeing spell reveals the boggart's natural form if it is in will-o'-wisp form.
Confusion			KEY:Boggart ~ Confusion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Once per day, as a full-round action, a boggart can unleash a screech that confuses all those hearing it within 30 ft. of the boggart. The confusion lasts for 6 rounds. An affected creature can make a DC 15 Will save to negate the effects. Each additional boggart within 10 feet that joins the screeching increases the save DC by +1. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Detect Thoughts			KEY:Boggart ~ Detect Thoughts	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A boggart can continuously detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 8th). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.
Electricity			KEY:Boggart ~ Electricity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A boggart delivers 2d6 points of electricity damage with a successful slam attack (DC 15 Fortitude for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.
Electrical Discharge		KEY:Boggart ~ Electrical Discharge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Once every other round as a standard action, a boggart can discharge a bolt of electricity in a 10-foot line. The bolt deals 2d6 points of electricity damage (DC 15 Reflex save for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.
Feed				KEY:Boggart ~ Feed	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:When a boggart slays a humanoid opponent, it can feed on the corpse, devouring both flesh and life force, as a full-round action. Feeding destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic. A boggart advances in Hit Dice by consuming corpses in this fashion. For every three suitable corpses a boggart devours, it gains 1 Hit Die, and its Strength, Constitution, and natural armor increase by +1. Its attack bonus and saves improve as normal for an aberration of its Hit Dice, and it gains skill ranks, feats, and ability score improvements normally. The boggart only advances by consuming the corpses of creatures whose Hit Dice or levels are equal to or greater than its own current total. A boggart that reaches 9 Hit Dice through feeding immediately becomes a will-o'-wisp upon completion of the act.
Immunity to Magic		KEY:Boggart ~ Immunity to Magic	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoggartRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Boggarts are immune to most spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, except magic missile, protection from evil, magic circle against evil, and maze.

These creatures fight as skeletons (see Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary), though their forms and structures do not necessarily have to resemble humanoids (or anything remotely humanoid). This ability otherwise functions similar to an animate dead spell (caster level 7th).
Bonestripping			KEY:BoneCobbler ~ Bonestripping	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoneCobblerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A bone cobbler can rapidly strip all the flesh from a Medium creature in 3 minutes using its claws and hammers. For each size category larger than Medium a corpse is, add 1 minute to the time it takes the bone cobbler to strip the corpse. For each size category smaller than Medium a corpse is, reduce the time by 1 minute (to a minimum of 1 minute). Once stripped, the bone cobbler devours the flesh and collects the victim's bones to use in its "sculptures". A creature slain in this manner can only be brought back to life by a miracle, wish, or true resurrection spell.
Two-Weapon Fighting		KEY:BoneCobbler ~ Two-Weapon Fighting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BoneCobblerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:In combination with its natural abilities, a bone cobbler's Two-Weapon Fighting feat allows it to attack with both of its weapons at no penalty to attack or damage.

Immunity to Magic		KEY:BrassMan ~ Immunity to Magic	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BrassManRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A brass man is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.  A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows a brass man (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.  A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the brass man and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the brass man to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A brass man gets no saving throw against fire effects.

A wooden weapon that strikes a brown pudding takes 2d6 acid damage unless it succeeds on a DC 21 Reflex save. If a brown pudding remains in contact with a wooden object for 1 full round, it inflicts 21 points of damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Corrosion			KEY:BrownPudding ~ Corrosion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BrownPuddingRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:An opponent that is being constricted by a brown pudding suffers a -4 penalty on Reflex saves made to resist acid damage applying to clothing and armor.
Suction				KEY:BrownPudding ~ Suction	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BrownPuddingRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The brown pudding can create powerful suction against any surfaces as it climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted surfaces with ease. A brown pudding can establish or release suction as a swift action, and as long as it is using suction, it moves at half speed. Because of the suction, a brown pudding's CMD score gets a +10 circumstance bonus to resist bull rush, awesome blows, and other attacks and effects that attempt to physically move it from its location.

It cannot run, wear armor, or enter water or other liquids. It can pass through holes and small openings-even cracks. It can also occupy spaces occupied by its enemies. (This ability is similar to a gaseous form spell-note the brume is not subject to wind effects like the gaseous form spell allows.) Any piercing or slashing attack against a brume has a 20% miss chance.  Bludgeoning attacks deal damage normally.
Lifesense			KEY:Brume ~ Lifesense	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BrumeRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A brume can automatically pinpoint the location of any living creature within 120 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.

The webs cover as much of the victim as possible, excluding the top of the victim's head, its eyes, and its nose. The webs remain attached to the cerebral stalker's body and stretch from just under its arms to its knees. A cocooned victim is anchored to the cerebral stalker and cannot move. The cocooned creature can, as a standard action, break free with a successful DC 20 Strength check or DC 16 Escape Artist check. The webbing has 8 hit points.

Sink				KEY:CerebralStalker ~ Sink	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CerebralStalkerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:After cocooning a foe, the cerebral stalker begins sinking into the ground, taking the cocooned victim with it. It takes four full rounds for the stalker and foe to completely sink into the ground. In the first round, the creature sinks to its knees; in the second round to its waist; in the third round to its neck; and in the last round, both stalker and foe are completely underground.  Sinking is a move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.  Creatures attempting to grab the cocooned victim and prevent the sinking must first break or burn the webbing (see above), and then succeed at a grapple check against the cerebral stalker. A dispel magic (or similar effect) cast on a sinking cerebral stalker paralyzes it (as if by a hold monster spell) for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level if the stalker fails a Fortitude save. The stalker can make a new save each round to negate the paralysis. The stalker and victim sink to a depth of 10 feet where the victim is placed in a stasis (similar to temporal stasis). The spot where the cerebral stalker and victim sunk radiates magic and can be detected normally. Spells such as locate object, discern location, scrying, and other divinatory magic reveals the entombed creature and stalker. A freedom spell cast on the spot where the stalker and victim sunk immediately frees the subject from the webbing and ejects both it and the stalker, who is stunned for 1 round, to the surface.

Sound-Related Vulnerabilities	KEY:Clamor ~ Sound-Related Vulnerabilities	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClamorRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Any magical silence effect or effect that creates a vacuum deals 3d6 points of damage to a clamor and forces it to make a successful Fortitude save (DC equal to 10 + spell level + spell caster's appropriate ability score modifier) or become panicked for 1 minute. In addition, the following spells can affect a clamor in unusual ways.  Ghost sound, major image, minor image, message, ventriloquism, whispering wind: These magically generated or altered sounds force a clamor to make a Will save (DC 10 + spell level + the caster's appropriate ability score modifier) or act as though affected by a confusion spell for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level.  Sculpt sound: If targeted directly at the clamor, this spell deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level. The clamor is allowed a Fortitude save for half damage. Alternately, a bard (and only a bard) using sculpt sound can attempt to completely control the actions of a clamor. The clamor is allowed an initial Fortitude save to negate the effect; if it fails, it is controlled as if by a dominate monster spell with a caster level equal to that of the bard's class level.  Shout, sound burst: These spells do no damage to a clamor, but force it to make a Will save or be affected as if by a charm monster spell with a caster level equal to that of the caster.

### Clockwork Brain Gear

Racial Abilities		KEY:ClockworkBrainGear ~ Racial Abilities		CATEGORY:Internal	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE:ClockworkBrainGearRaceAbility
Control Clockwork		KEY:ClockworkBrainGear ~ Control Clockwork	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClockworkBrainGearRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Any clockwork that comes within two miles of a brain gear immediately falls under that brain gear's control. If more than one brain gear attempts to control a clockwork (or if the clockwork is under the control of another brain gear or overseer), each gear must make an opposed Intelligence check; the winner gains control of that clockwork. When a clockwork moves more than 2 miles away from a brain gear, it continues to perform the last order given to it, but there is a 25% percent chance each hour that it ceases to function, collapsing into a pile of junk. If a brain gear later moves within two miles of the destroyed clockwork, the clockwork can reactivate if it has the self-repair ability. Otherwise, it remains destroyed. A brain gear in control of at least one clockwork can, as a free action once per round, use that clockwork to perceive the world through its senses (such as seeing the area surrounding the clockwork). This ability has a range of 2 miles. If a brain gear controls multiple clockworks, it can instantaneously jump from clockwork to clockwork, keeping tabs on all of its thralls and perceiving the world through their senses. A brain gear can switch control from one clockwork to another once per round as a free action. A brain gear uses this ability to give commands to its clockworks, allowing the usually mindless creatures to fight with highly coordinated tactics. Each clockwork is capable of receiving roughly 100 words worth of orders. Anything beyond that is too complicated for the clockwork to handle.
Dream				KEY:ClockworkBrainGear ~ Dream	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClockworkBrainGearRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The brain gear has a limited ability to send psychic messages. Once per week, it can create an effect similar to a dream spell (caster level 10th). The brain gear can contact multiple creatures by designating a generic creature type, such as ogre or human. This designation affects every member of the target type within a 2-mile radius of the brain gear.

Independent Clockwork		KEY:ClockworkOverseer ~ Independent Clockwork	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClockworkOverseerRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:An overseer can move beyond the brain gear's normal area of influence while maintaining contact with it. Normally, a brain gear can control only clockworks that are within two miles of its position. A brain gear can control an overseer that stays within 10 miles of its position. In addition, the overseer can act as a field commander for up to 20 HD worth of clockworks that are within 100 feet of its position. These clockworks are considered to be in contact with the brain gear so long as the overseer is in contact with it.

### Clockwork Parasite

Control Host			KEY:ClockworkParasite ~ Control Host	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClockworkParasiteRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:By burrowing into the base of a corpse's skull and attaching itself with its pincers, a parasite clockwork can animate the creature (similar to an animate dead spell). The animated creature uses its own HD, base attack, saves, and hit points. It has an effective Wisdom of 10 and Charisma of 1. It does not have an Intelligence score. The host loses all skills, feats, class abilities, supernatural abilities, and spell-like abilities (including the ability to cast spells) it possessed in life. It retains its AC and any natural attacks it possessed, including proficiency with weapons. A host retains any proficiency with armor and shields it possessed while alive.  Spells such as detect undead or detect magic do not reveal the presence of the parasite or host. So long as the parasite clockwork remains in contact with the host, the control remains in effect.  A host brought to 0 or less hit points is destroyed, but can be repaired by the clockwork parasite using its self-repair ability (though this only works if the host is brought to 0 or less hit points; a host does not gain the self-repair ability of the parasite while "alive").
Self-Repair			KEY:ClockworkParasite ~ Self-Repair	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClockworkParasiteRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A clockwork parasite regains 1 hit point per round.

Damage dealt from acid, cold, or fire effects cannot be self-repaired. If a clockwork swarm takes damage from an area attack, it is unable to repair itself for 1d6 rounds following the attack. If reduced to 0 or less hit points, it regains 1 hit point per round (but still cannot repair damage caused by acid, cold, or fire effects) until it has at least 1 hit point (at which time it begins to self-repair at its normal rate of 3 hit points per round).

When a cloud dragon uses its breath weapon, make a single bull rush attack using the dragon's CMB against the CMD of any creature that failed its Reflex save and is three or more size categories smaller than the dragon. This bull rush does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the dragon cannot choose to move with any opponent pushed back. In addition to being pushed back, affected creatures are knocked prone and take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet they are pushed back. Flying creatures are buffeted and pushed back twice the distance and sustain 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet they are pushed back.
Cold Bite			KEY:CloudDragon ~ Cold Bite	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CloudDragonRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At old age, a cloud dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of cold damage. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to 6d6.

If it has fastened its death grip on a victim, it releases its hold when it falls. A DC 20 Sense Motive check sees through the ruse (necromancers gain a +2 competence bonus on this check). On its next turn, the coffer corpse rises again as if reanimated, triggering its fear ability.
Fear				KEY:CofferCorpse ~ Fear	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CofferCorpseRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A creature viewing a coffer corpse rise after it uses its deceiving death ability must make a DC 13 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds.

Hypnotic Lights			KEY:CorpseCandle ~ Hypnotic Lights	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorpseCandleRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The corpse candle possesses the ability to create a dancing, twisting pattern of ever-shifting lights that slowly change colors.  The corpse candle can create these lights within 20 feet of itself, covering an area in a 10foot radius spread (usually underwater). Creatures viewing the pattern within 50 feet must make a successful Will save (DC 18) or become fascinated. If the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by that corpse candle's hypnotic lights for one day. The lights remain for as long as the corpse candle concentrates plus 1 minute. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. A fascinated victim moves toward the lights, taking the most direct route available at its normal movement rate. The creature avoids certain dangers (walking off a cliff, walking through fire, etc.) and skirts around such obstructions if possible, but it will swim towards the light if necessary, paying no heed to the need for air. If no path to the light is available, the fascination is broken. Any living creature within the area of light at the end of its turn takes 1d2 points of Constitution damage. This is a death effect.

### Corruptor Demon

Racial Abilities		KEY:CorruptorDemon ~ Racial Abilities		CATEGORY:Internal	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE:CorruptorDemonRaceAbility
Whisper of Madness		KEY:CorruptorDemon ~ Whisper of Madness	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorruptorDemonRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:When summoned, a demon of corruption automatically establishes a mental link between itself and the one who summoned it (the host). Distance is not a factor to maintain the link, and it can span across planes and dimensions. The demon need not concentrate to maintain the link. A corruptor demon can have in existence at one time a number of links equal to its current HD. A corruptor demon can break a link it has established any time as a free action.  The link allows the demon to speak (as if by telepathy) to the host and submit subconscious thoughts and messages to him or her. Once per task requested of the corruptor demon (or once per week if no task is requested, including fractions of a week if dismissed early), as long as the link is in existence, the host must succeed on a Will save (DC 11 barizou; DC 12 azizou; DC 13 geruzou) or have his alignment shift one increment toward chaotic evil; first along the good-evil axis and then along the lawful-chaotic axis. The save DC is Charisma-based and increases by +1 each week the link is maintained. A successful save prevents the alignment shift for that week but does not break the link.  When  the  host's  alignment  completely  shifts  to chaotic evil (or if the host is chaotic evil when the link  is  first  established),  he  must  immediately succeed on a Will save (DC 15 barizou; DC 16 azizou; DC 17 geruzou) or go permanently insane (as if affected by an insanity spell, caster level 8th). The save DCs are Charisma-based and include a +4 racial bonus.  A  successful  save  negates  the  insanity for  one  month,  after  which  time  a  new save  (same  DC)  must  be  made  again. This cycle continues until the host fails  a save and goes insane or until the link between  host  and  corruptor  demon  is broken. The  link  is  blocked  by  lead  and magical  protection  (antimagic  field,  mind blank, and nondetection) and can be dispelled through magical means (dispel magic, greater restoration, and the like).  The  alignment  shift  caused  by  these  demons can only be removed after the link is broken. This requires the host to voluntarily (meaning no magical intervention such as charm person or suggestion) subject himself to a greater restoration spell. One such spell is needed for each shift along the law-chaos and good-evil axes. If the host was originally good-aligned, he must voluntarily subject himself to an atonement spell.
Aligned Weapons 		KEY:CorruptorDemon ~ Aligned Weapons 	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CorruptorDemonRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A corruptor demon's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Stalagmite Form			KEY:CragMan ~ Stalagmite Form	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CragManRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Once per round as a swift action a crag man can transform itself to or from the form of a stalagmite of equivalent size.

Blood Frenzy			KEY:CrimsonBasilisk ~ Blood Frenzy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CrimsonBasiliskRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A crimson basilisk that detects fresh blood within 30 feet enters a frenzied state the following round, along with all other crimson basilisks within 30 feet. Frenzied crimson basilisks fight until they or their opponents are dead. A frenzied crimson basilisk gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls and -2 AC for 1 minute. The creature cannot end the frenzy voluntarily. A crimson basilisk can enter a frenzy only once per encounter.
Wounding Gaze			KEY:CrimsonBasilisk ~ Wounding Gaze	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CrimsonBasiliskRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A living creature within 30 feet that meets the gaze of a crimson basilisk must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or take 1d3 points of Constitution damage as blood weeps from the victim's eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. Creatures without blood (undead, plants, oozes) and other crimson basilisks are immune to the effects of this gaze. The save DC is Charisma-based.

### Crucifixion Spirit

Racial Abilities		KEY:CrucifixionSpirit ~ Racial Abilities		CATEGORY:Internal	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE:CrucifixionSpiritRaceAbility
Crucify Soul			KEY:CrucifixionSpirit ~ Crucify Soul	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CrucifixionSpiritRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Five times per day as an attack action a crucifixion spirit can point at a single living target within 60 feet and crucify its soul. This requires the crucifixion spirit to succeed at a ranged touch attack. If successful, the target's soul is ripped from its body, which collapses in a heap on the ground. The target's soul appears as a translucent copy of the victim and is suspended above the spot its body collapsed, crucified in midair to a translucent, "X" shaped structure, the soul held in place by translucent spikes or nails. The victim is not dead and is visible to all those viewing it. A crucified soul cannot be attacked or affected by anything, cannot take any actions (other than trying to escape, see below), and experiences excruciating pain that deals 2 negative levels to it in the round it is crucified, and one negative level each round thereafter. The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 22. The save DCs are Charisma-based. A crucifixion spirit does not need to concentrate on this ability for it to continue to affect a target. It can direct attacks against a different opponent. A crucified creature can attempt to escape each round by making a DC 22 Will save. If successful, the creature's soul is freed from its torment and returns to its body in the same round. The target is stunned for one round, but afterwards can act normally. A creature slain with this ability cannot be returned to life except through the casting of a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell. Even then, there is a 50% chance that such magic fails. If the check fails, the creature cannot be restored to life by mortal magic.
Immune Channel Energy		KEY:CrucifixionSpirit ~ Immune Channel Energy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CrucifixionSpiritRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A crucifixion spirit takes no damage from the channel energy ability, and is not affected by effects that mimic channel energy or are based on the channel energy ability (such as turn undead and command undead).

Teleport Other			KEY:CryptThing ~ Teleport Other	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CryptThingRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Once per day as a standard action, a crypt thing can teleport all creatures within 50 feet of it to a randomly determined location.  An affected creature can attempt a DC 20 Will save to negate the effects. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.  An affected creature is teleported in a random direction (roll 1d4: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; 4, west) and a random distance (1d10 x 100 feet) away from the crypt thing. Roll randomly for each creature that fails its saving throw.  A teleported creature arrives in the closest open space at the determined destination. A teleported creature can arrive in mid-air rather than on a solid surface, if the crypt thing wishes. A creature that arrives in mid-air takes falling damage when it contacts a solid surface (unless it has some means to prevent falling, such as the ability to fly, or a feather fall spell).

Acid				KEY:CrystalOoze ~ Acid	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CrystalOozeRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The digestive acid that covers a crystal ooze dissolves metals and organic material, but not stone.  Each slam and constrict attack deals 1d6 additional acid damage. Armor or clothing worn by a creature grappled by a crystal ooze takes the same amount of acid damage unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex saving throw. A wooden or metal weapon that strikes a crystal ooze takes 1d6 acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex save. The ooze's touch deals 12 points of acid damage per round to wooden or metal objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the material for 1 full round in order to deal this damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Transparency			KEY:CrystalOoze ~ Transparency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CrystalOozeRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Due to its lack of vivid coloration, a crystal ooze is difficult to discern from its surroundings in most environments. A DC 15 Perception check is required to notice the ooze. Any creature that fails to notice a crystal ooze and walks into it automatically suffers damage as if struck by the ooze's slam attack and is immediately subject to a grab attempt by the ooze.
Water Dependency		KEY:CrystalOoze ~ Water Dependency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CrystalOozeRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Crystal oozes can survive out of the water for 1 hour per 4 points of Constitution (after that, refer to the drowning rules in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook).
