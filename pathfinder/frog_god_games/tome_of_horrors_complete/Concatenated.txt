Kraken's Bite: Moloch's unique weapon is a Large +4 unholy shocking six-tailed whip. It does lethal damage as a heavy flail and does threaten the squares in its range but has the reach of a whip. In addition if used to make trip or disarm attacks, then the wielder can make six trip or disarm attempts in a round as a full-round action and receive the benefits of having both the Improved Trip and Improved Disarm feats, even if he does not have the necessary prerequisites.

Servants of Moloch

Followers of Moloch are evil humanoids and usually consist of assassins,
clerics, sorcerers, and wizards. Devout followers of Moloch are called Knights of Moloch and must sign a pact of evil with Moloch. Knights can receive spells from Moloch and are granted access to two of the following domains: Evil, Law, and Strength.

-----------------------------------------------

ELEMENTAL CONSTRUCTS
DESC:Elemental constructs are golems or automatons forged of one of the four basic elements-air, earth, fire, or water-bound to serve their creator. The creation of an elemental construct requires no less than five elemental spirits(of the same type) which are unwillingly bound into the form of the elemental construct.  Elemental constructs are used by powerful mages as servants, bodyguards, and assassins. An elemental construct, like any other automaton follows any order or command given to it to the best of its ability.

An elemental construct's creator can command it if the construct is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If not commanded, an elemental construct usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the elemental construct a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence. The elemental construct's creator can order the construct to obey the commands of another person (who might in turn place the elemental construct under someone else's control, and so on), but the elemental construct's creator can always resume control over his creation by commanding the elemental construct to obey him alone.

Each elemental construct appears as a humanoid creature about 9 feet tall and is composed entirely of its native element.

Construction
An elemental construct's body is formed completely of one of the four elements air, earth, fire, or water. The materials must be the finest quality or purest form taken from the respective plane and mixed with rare oils, powders, and other ingredients totaling 5,000 gp.

ELEMENTAL CONSTRUCT
CL 17th; Price 200,000 gp

Requirements Craft Construct (see the Bestiary), geas/ quest, limited wish, two spells of 4th level or higher with the appropriate elemental descriptor, creator must be caster level 17th; Skill Craft (sculptures) DC 20;

Anodized (Improved) Magnesium Golem
The golem is anodized during the creation process by submerging it in a solution of acid. During this time, the creator must cast lightning or some other electricity-based effect into the solution. This deals no damage to the golem. After four hours, the magnesium golem is removed from the solution.  An anodized magnesium golem is identical to a normal magnesium golem detailed above but it does not have the rust vulnerability trait of the normal magnesium golem. This increases the golem's price by 2,000 gp.

Graymalkin

GRAYMALKINS
DESC:Graymalkins are magical creatures that resemble ordinary cats. To the casual observer, a graymalkin appear  to be nothing more than a raggedy-looking cat with nothing unusual about it. This disguise aids the graymalkin
in its travels, allowing it to move unmolested among living creatures.

Graymalkins always dwell near populated areas, preferring cities to towns, towns to villages, and so on. They often choose an owner (a living creature they deem gullible and easily manipulated) and convince that creature to take them home with them (by using their fascination ability). Once inside their owner's house, a graymalkin uses its special abilities to kill its owner and any other family members. Such attacks usually occur at night (in the case of the slinker) or over a period of time (in the case of the tether).

Graymalkins are often found serving as the familiar to an evil spellcaster or hag. They prefer females to males when serving as a familiar and very rarely do they ever use their special abilities against their true owner. (Some tales say that when a graymalkin is serving as a familiar, its master is actually immune to its special abilities.)

Graymalkins avoid  direct  confrontations with  opponents,  preferring to attack helpless or otherwise unobservant foes. If forced into battle, a graymalkin seeks escape as quick as possible.

All graymalkins possess the following ability.

Inphidian

Somewhere in humanities lost aeons a race of malformed serpentine humanoids rose, now known as inphidians. While the truth of their origins has been long forgotten, most sages subscribe to one of two theories. The first states the creatures are the failed results of horrific experiments performed by the dark and nameless sorcerers of an ancient snakecult in their attempts to ensorcel their followers. The second theory contends the inphidians were once a cult of snakeworshippers cursed by an ancient snake-god for some transgression against the ethos. Whatever the truth, it appears as of late that the inphidians have evolved into true race, beyond the machinations of arcane experiments or curses. While there exist several known species, recent reports describe encounters with yet unidentified inphidians and others are sure to surface as encounters with the race grow more frequent.

All inphidians, regardless of the subspecies, have viper heads in place of their hands. The creatures use these in combat to deliver a powerful bite that injects the victim with poison. Inphidians, particularly the craftsmen, wear special gloves called inphidian gauntlets that let them use their hands like any other humanoid with five digits (including an opposing thumb) uses its hands. See the sidebar for details on inphidian gauntlets.

ORCS
DESC:Orc tribes are feared and reviled throughout the planes for their depravities and their penchant for destruction and mindless violence. The vast majority of orcs are easy enough to identify by their jutting jaw, yellowed tusks, squinting eyes and hairy, brutally muscular frames. Their skin color tends to run the gamut from blue-black to grey, with  putrid slime green being the most common. Many tribes of orcs however have adopted traits unique to their own species through interbreeding with other races, adaptation to climate and terrain, and the intervention of evil magicians or other-planar powers.

SEA SERPENTS
DESC:Nearly as old as the dragons that roam the sky are the sea serpents, great snakelike creatures that have roamed the oceans for ages. Unlike the classical dragon, these great, scaly, serpentine beasts are generally agreed to be a product of evolution, though many suspect magical influence, either deliberate or natural, somewhere in their evolution.

Whatever their origins, sea serpents are a highly varied species, with a great variation in size, coloration, intellect, and temperament. However, all sea serpents bear certain similarities. They are long, serpentine, warmblooded creatures that closely resemble snakes in appearance, though they all have two sets of flippers, which may be large or so small and atrophied as to be nearly unnoticeable. Sea serpents are aquatic creatures, though some can make their way about on land. All sea serpents can breathe both water and air with equal efficiency, another fact that distinguishes them from marine mammals and reptiles. Further, all sea serpents are sentient, with an intellect ranging from little greater than moronic to supra-genius level.

One trait that sea serpents share in common with their draconic brethren is a sense of innate superiority, a feeling that they are masters of the sea, at least in whatever manner they choose to pursue their expertise.

Unlike dragons, however, sea serpents are not distinguished by color or age category. And while some species are as acquisitive as dragons, others have no interest in hoarding wealth, and live lives little better than beasts.

All sea serpents can speak and understand Aquatic, and many know Draconic as well. The more intelligent species may also learn the languages of marine civilizations, or the languages of sea-traveling surface dwellers. Due to their physical similarities, sea serpents use fairly consistent tactics in combat situations. All sea serpents have venomous bites, and they use this to their advantage to slow or immobilize multiple attackers so they can concentrate on one foe. In addition to their lethal bite, all sea serpents have the ability to ensnare prey in their coils as a giant constrictor does and crush the life out of them. The larger sea serpents may even use this constriction attack against sea vessels, and mariners in their smoky dens delight in recounting tales of horror and woe of great serpents that splinter hulls and then devour the helpless sailors in the water.

Because they are sentient beings, sea serpents can often be reasoned with, even if the reasoning is no more complex than simple intimidation. They are adaptable to circumstances, and none throw themselves into battle rashly.

Feats: All sea serpents have Swim-By Attack as a bonus feat.

Spriggan
DESC:Spriggans are among the ugliest and certainly the most foul tempered of all gnomes. At one moment a normal-sized gnome, a spriggan can grow to giant-sized in an instant, gaining immense strength and taking unsuspecting opponents by surprise.

Spriggans are, by human standards, quite homely. They have stocky bodies and sickly ochre-colored skin and dark hair of brown of black. Male spriggans favor facial hair such as shaggy mustaches and ratty beards, but any head or facial hair they have is unkempt and filthy. Female spriggans do not have facial hair. Being unhygienic creatures, spriggans never bathe or clean their clothing or equipment. Thanks to their filthy lifestyle, spriggans reek with the foulness of dirt, body odor, and other unpleasantness. Despite being gnomes themselves, spriggans despise all of their gnomish kinfolk.

A typical spriggan stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs 50 to 55 pounds. An enlarged spriggan stands about 8-1/2 feet tall and weighs 500 to 550 pounds.

Spriggans make the best use of their magical abilities in combat. When several spriggans are encountered, some will enlarge themselves at the first sign of melee, while the remainder will stay Small and take advantage of their innate abilities of stealth and sneak attacks. Owing to their chaotic nature, complex battle plans are generally beyond most spriggan mobs; it is likely that some, none, or all spriggans in a mob will change size at the start of melee.

Sea Sprite

Sea sprites are the aquatic version of normal sprites. As their name implies, they are joyful fey who dwell in the sea. Their hair resembles strands of seaweed and they have large, fish-like eyes. The skin of a sea sprite is pale blue. Lacking wings, sea sprites cannot fly, but thanks to fine webbing in their fingers and toes they are adept swimmers. Sea sprites can breathe both air and water without difficulty. Like normal sprites, sea sprites make use of special ammunition that put their opponents to sleep. Sea sprites have the same statistics as their land-dwelling brethren, with the following exceptions: They have the aquatic and amphibious subtypes; they do not have a fly speed but have a swim speed of 30 feet, and their Swim score is +12 (Swim score is based on their Dexterity, not their Strength). They employ crossbows rather than shortbows, and prefer spears over short swords.

A raven swarm is a disorienting mass  of  angered  birds.  Raven swarms  have  the  same  general characteristics	and	habitat	of normal ravens.

Raven swarms attack by surrounding their   prey,   pecking,   scratching   and clawing  until  destroyed  or  frightened
away. They specifically seek the head, face and eyes of victims.

Turtle-Shark
DESC:From a distance this creature resembles a giant snapping turtle. It has a peaked and craggy shell from which protrude four long fins and a scowling head at the end of a long neck. Rather than a turtle's head, however, this creature's head has irrefutably shark-like features. It has round, black eyes and a gaping maw filled with rows of razor sharp teeth. Its head and fins are dark grayish-green. A turtle-shark surprises many foes with its quickness in the water. Many assume that it is as slow as its other shelled kin, and underestimate its shark-like speed. Like its predatory cousins, a turtle-shark attacks nearly anything it can reach, especially if there is blood or activity in the water.

Vegepygmy
DESC:This creature resembles a humanoid with green vegetable-like skin and razor-sharp claws. Its head sports two large yellow eyes, a wide mouth, inset nose, and a topknot of dark brown leaves. Leafy tendrils protrude from its shoulders, midsection, arms, and legs.


When a living creature is slain by russet mold (see that entry), it rises as a vegepygmy commoner. Vegepygmies are low-intelligence plants that make their home deep in the forests or underground away from most settled areas. They are hunters and scavengers, and carnivorous, preying on living creatures weaker than themselves.

A vegepygmy ranges from two feet to four and a half feet tall. Though they do not seem to have ears, it is well known that vegepygmies can hear.  Vegepygmies do not speak, but communicate with others of their kind

by thumping their chest or rapping their spears on rocks, earth, or some	other solid surface. It is not known if or how they communicate with other creatures.  Vegepygmies attack with claws or weapons, usually either a longspear or club. They prefer to ambush opponents, using their coloration to	blend with their natural surroundings.

WEIRDS
DESC:Weirds are creatures from the various inner and outer planes (including the demi-, para-, and quasi-elemental planes as well as the elemental planes).

They are sometimes encountered on the Material Plane, often in the employ of a powerful spellcaster. Bribery is the usual means of gaining the services of a weird, though some spellcasters resort to even more deceitful practices or trickery to gain the services of these creatures. Spellcaster beware! Weirds are intelligent creatures and do not take kindly to deception (unless they are the ones engaging in such trickery).

All weirds, regardless of their makeup, are serpent-like creatures about 10 feet long, and being of an evil and malign nature. Weirds speak the common language of weirds and the language native to their home plane. Some speak more languages, and still some can speak Common.

Giant Horned Chameleon

The giant  horned  chameleon  is  a territorial creature  and  is  rarely
encountered with another of its kind except during mating season.

Giant horned chameleons are green or dark green. Males are distinguished by the three large horns protruding from their head. This
grants them a gore attack (1d8 + Strength modifier) that they can use
in lieu of a bite or tongue attack. Females possess the same horns, but they are usually underdeveloped (dealing 1d6 + Strength modifier). These
chameleons have a crest on the back of their head, and bony ridges and spines running the length of their back.

Rock Chameleon

Rock  chameleons  resemble  common  giant  chameleons  but  their natural coloration is gray and they are only found in warm and temperate mountains where their coloration allows them to blend in with their surroundings. They use the stats for the common giant chameleon, but only gain the bonus to Stealth checks in rocky surroundings.
